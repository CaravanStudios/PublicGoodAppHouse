## Jury Instructions

Hi XXX, 

Thank you for participating in the Cultural Memory Lab’s review committee\!

We are announcing the finalists at the end of the month, so please complete your review (it should take about two hours) via Airtable review form before **DATE**.

To complete the review process, please follow these steps:

1. You will receive an invitation via email from us to join an interface in Airtable.  
2. Accept the invitation in the email and follow the prompts to create an Airtable account.  
3. You will then be redirected to an Airtable interface which contains the 15 applications you’ll need to review.  
   1. The application review interface can also be accessed via this link: XXXX   
4. To view each application, click on an application’s row. A side panel will pop up; read through the submitter’s responses.  
5. Use the review rubric (7 fields with the option to choose a star rating) at the bottom of the side panel to score each application  
   1. Score the application on each of the 7 criteria (also included in this email; see below) on a scale of 1-5, 1 meaning “not at all” and 5 meaning “absolutely.”  
   2. Optionally, you may also leave comments in the “Notes” field to give further context to your ratings.  
   3. Note: please do not edit the application response fields; only edit the star rating and Notes fields.  
6. That’s it\! Repeat this process for all 18 applications.

The review criteria are listed on the review forms, but I’m including them here for your reference. All are scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 meaning “not at all” and 5 meaning “absolutely”).

* How well does the project align with the overarching goals of the program?  
* Does the project address itself to a particular community and does the project team faithfully represent that community?  
* Does the project meaningfully address a gap in cultural memory practices?  
* Does the applicant propose a feasible implementation of decentralized technologies?  
* Does the applicant propose a meaningful implementation of decentralized technologies? In other words, are the affordances of decentralized tools adequately and appropriately leveraged in service of archiving cultural memory?  
* Does the applicant or team have the necessary expertise and experience to execute the project?  
* Does the applicant demonstrate a clear need for the support offered by the program?

Thank you once again for your support, and please let me know if you have any questions\! Happy to schedule a call to walk through the process if anything is confusing. 

Best,

XXX
