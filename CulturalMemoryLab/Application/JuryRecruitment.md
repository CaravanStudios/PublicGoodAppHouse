Dear \[insert name\],

I hope this message finds you well. Given your valuable expertise in \[decentralized technologies/digital cultural preservation\], I'm writing to invite you to join the application review committee for the [Cultural Memory Lab](https://grayarea.org/initiative/cultural-memory-lab/) â€” an innovative incubator and microgranting program that empowers organizations to build publicly accessible digital archives utilizing decentralized technologies.

The Lab is a collaborative initiative between [Gray Area](https://grayarea.org/) and [TechSoup](https://www.techsoup.org/), supported by the [Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web](https://ffdweb.org/). Your insights would be instrumental in identifying projects that demonstrate the most promising approaches to leveraging decentralized protocols for cultural preservation.

The commitment involves:

* Reviewing approximately 15 applications  
* Evaluating submissions against established selection criteria  
* Completing an online review form between February 18-24, 2025  
  * Evaluations will be completed via an Airtable interface; our team will create an instruction video to walk through this process.  
* Total estimated time commitment: 2 hours

Serving on the Cultural Memory Lab application review committee represents an opportunity to amplify critical projects working to advance digital preservation, as well as to help shape how decentralized technologies are deployed in the cultural sphere. Gray Area and TechSoup will recognize your contributions through a blog post and social media feature. 

Your participation would directly contribute to helping cultural organizations develop more resilient, decentralized approaches to preserving our collective digital heritage. We believe your background in \[specific area of expertise\] would bring a crucial perspective to our selection process.

I'm happy to schedule a brief call to discuss this opportunity in more detail or answer any questions you may have about the program or the review process.

Thank you for considering this invitation. We look forward to potentially working with you.

All best,

XX
