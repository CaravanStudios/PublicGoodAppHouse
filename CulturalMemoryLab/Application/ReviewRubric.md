## Instructions for Application Review

Thank you for participating in the Cultural Memory Lab’s review committee\! 

We are announcing the finalists at the end of the month, so please complete your review (it should take about two hours) via Airtable review form before **DATE**.

The following instructions will guide you through the application review process.

### Application Review Steps:

1. You will receive an invitation via email from us to join an interface in Airtable.  
2. Accept the invitation in the email and follow the prompts to create an Airtable account.  
3. You will then be redirected to an Airtable interface which contains the 15 applications you’ll need to review.  
4. To view each application, click on an application’s row. A side panel will pop up; read through the submitter’s responses.  
5. Use the review rubric (7 fields with the option to choose a star rating) at the bottom of the side panel to score each application  
   1. Score the application on each of the 7 criteria (also included in this document; see below) on a scale of 1-5, 1 meaning “not at all” and 5 meaning “absolutely.”  
   2. Optionally, you may also leave comments in the “Notes” field to give further context to your ratings.  
   3. Note: please do not edit the application response fields; only edit the star rating and Notes fields.  
6. That’s it\! Repeat this process for all 15 applications.
