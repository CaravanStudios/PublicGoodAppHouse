 # Cultural Memory Lab: Participant Agreement Template

Welcome to the **Cultural Memory Lab: Participant Agreement** template. This document outlines the roles, responsibilities, and benefits of participating in the Cultural Memory Lab — an initiative to explore decentralized storage and preservation of cultural memory.

This agreement was originally developed for the 2025 cohort of the Cultural Memory Lab, a collaboration between TechSoup, Gray Area, and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. It is shared here as a resource for other organizations, programs, or funders that wish to design similar engagements. The language and structure can be adapted to suit your specific needs.
