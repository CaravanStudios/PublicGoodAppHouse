**Coming Soon: Your Guide to Archiving with IPFS**

One of the core goals of the Cultural Memory Lab is to give you hands-on experience with tools like IPFS — and next month, we’ll be sharing a practical guide to help you do just that.  
The step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of uploading your first files to IPFS using [Storacha.network](https://storacha.network). You’ll learn how to:

* Prepare your test files for upload  
* Write a simple ReadMe file with helpful context and metadata  
* Upload a folder to Storacha  
* Add IPFS links to your existing website  
* Create your own description to explain what decentralized storage is — and why your project is incorporating it into your practice

This is all about learning by doing, so don’t worry if you’re new to this. We’re here to support you every step of the way.
