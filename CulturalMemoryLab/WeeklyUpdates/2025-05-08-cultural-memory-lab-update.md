**Subject**: Cultural Memory Lab Weekly Update #6

Hi Cultural Memory Lab-ers\!

### **Memory Keepers Circle**

Thank you, Nas, for sharing your powerful story about the importance of archives in intergenerational knowledge sharingâ€”and the opportunity   
to see ourselves in our communities. Beautifully told\!

If you missed it or want to experience it again, you can [watch the recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WWHP-RSBrluyTarPEJv2MHNmVxfHlEtr/view?usp=sharing).

Weâ€™re excited to share that Chase has also offered to tell a storyâ€”stay tuned for the date announcement soon.

And weâ€™d love to hear from more of you\! Whether itâ€™s what inspired your work or a lesson learned along the way, your stories matter. In the spirit of decentralization, we also welcome your ideas for hosting cohort gatherings. Is there a skill you want to explore or a topic youâ€™re passionate about? Let us knowâ€”weâ€™re here to help make it happen.

**DWeb Course \- Next Session**

In this Sundayâ€™s praxis session, youâ€™ll get hands on with hosting your own web services with YunoHost, a community-supported platform that provides access to dozens of different self-hosted applications. Have fun cloudbusting\!

**Technical Support from FFDW**

Reminder to book time with Ian from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web [here](https://calendly.com/ian-fil) if you havenâ€™t already and want support in approaching decentralized storage for your archive.

Enjoy the rest of your week\!
