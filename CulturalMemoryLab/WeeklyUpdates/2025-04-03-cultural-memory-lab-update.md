SUBJECT: Welcome to the Cultural Memory Lab 

**Hey Cultural Memory Lab-er,**

Welcome to the Cultural Memory Lab. Over the next four months, we will learn to leverage decentralized technologies to preserve stories historically excluded from archival practices.

If you missed this week‚Äôs orientation call, here is a [link to the video replay](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZDFsBEN1xpoPpTVPYmHo7ewtkub3dQg/view?usp=sharing).

Every week we‚Äôll send you a brief email, like this one, with an update on your journey through the Cultural Memory Lab.

üìÜ **Project Team Leads:** Please schedule a 1:1 conversation with Billy Bicket, Head of Maker Labs, to discuss your specific project needs and questions: Schedule with Billy on his calendly page [here](https://calendly.com/makerstudios/maker-check-in) (This is a  45-minute onboarding conversation structured to understand your projects‚Äô true technical state, challenges, and needs, so that TechSoup can connect you with the right resources, expertise and peer support you need, based on where things are today).

### **DWeb Opportunities of the Week üåê**

We‚Äôre always on the lookout for cool opportunities and resources to support your work‚Äîif you come across something great, feel free to share it with the group\!

* [TRANSFER](https://transfergallery.com/) is currently deploying the MVP of their Archive Engine with artist studios and like-minded organizations. This is a local-first archive infrastructure that links together NAS nodes with a private IPFS network, creating networks of trust on decentralized storage infrastructure. They‚Äôd like to invite FFDW project partners to try it out in the early stage for input.

* The [CuttingRoom Reporter app](https://proofmode.org/blog/cuttingroom) now enables journalists to cryptographically sign and timestamp their captured media right from their smartphones. This creates an unbreakable chain of evidence, as close to ‚Äúglass to glass‚Äù as possible, proving that the content hasn‚Äôt been tampered with since capture.
