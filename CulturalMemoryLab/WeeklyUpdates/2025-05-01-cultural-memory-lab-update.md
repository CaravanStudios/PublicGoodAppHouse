**Subject:** Cultural Memory Lab Weekly Update #5

Hi Cultural Memory Lab-ers\!

Thanks to everyone who was able to attend our first Technical Workshop with Ian Davis from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web\! We learned a lot about CIDs, shards, IPFS gateways and other ways to interface with content on the decentralized web. For those of you who weren‚Äôt able to make it, you can check out a [private recording here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LI81HA3mTXJumWgSSB2-M47eGrcpoRSY/view?usp=sharing) (please do not share outside of our cohort ‚Äì thanks\!).

We will share upcoming technical workshops in the coming months. But in the meantime, Ian has offered to sit down (virtually) with project teams for 1-on-1 technical coaching sessions. This is a great way to develop a decentralized storage architecture and approach tailored to your specific project. Use [this link](https://calendly.com/ian-fil) to book time with Ian\!

**Memory Keepers Circle**

You asked for an opportunity to connect with the other Cultural Memory Lab cohort members, and we believe we have a great way to foster genuine connections. Join us on Wednesday, May 7 at 8 am PT for our first **Memory Keepers Circle**, where we pause the technical talk to reflect on the deeper ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind our work. We will open the circle with a 7-minute story about what drew us to cultural preservation. This simple, powerful format invites one person to share while others witness‚Äîno fixing, no feedback, just presence. It‚Äôs a rare chance to connect as humans first, technologists second, and remember what drives us. Others in the cohort will be invited to share in future circles, so come see what it‚Äôs all about\!

We will send you a calendar invite soon.

**DWeb Opportunities of the Week üåê**  
Not *exactly* DWeb-related, but the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University has announced a fellowship opportunity with focus on technology, policy and ethics. Learn more [here](https://cyber.harvard.edu/getinvolved/fellowships/bkc-allen-lab)\!

That‚Äôs all for now ‚Äî as always, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if there are additional ways Gray Area and TechSoup can support your important work\!
