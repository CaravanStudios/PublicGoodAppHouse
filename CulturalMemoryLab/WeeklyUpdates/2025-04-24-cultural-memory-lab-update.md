Hi Cultural Memory Lab-ers\!

We have one last project joining the cohort. Please join me in welcoming **Archiving Myanmar’s Digital Landscape** into the Cultural Memory Lab. The team discovered our cohort experience through participation in our local DWeb Node events in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

Archiving Myanmar’s Digital Landscape is a grassroots project of the Myanmar Internet Project, focused on preserving cultural and historical documents threatened by the Myanmar junta’s closing of civil society space.

Learn more about their work in our [blog post announcing the launch of the Cultural Memory Lab](https://acceleratingmakers.publicgoodapphouse.org/blog/_blog-posts/introducing-the-cultural-memory-lab-cohort-empowering-community-archives-through-decentralized-technology).

**To Do:**  
**🗂️Need help navigating decentralized storage?**  
Join us for a private workshop with Filecoin to explore how they can support your project’s storage goals. We’re excited to welcome **Ian Davis, Filecoin’s Senior Technologist**, who’s offering **1:1 support** tailored to your needs. This session is your chance to connect directly, share your goals, and set the stage for your upcoming personalized consultation.
