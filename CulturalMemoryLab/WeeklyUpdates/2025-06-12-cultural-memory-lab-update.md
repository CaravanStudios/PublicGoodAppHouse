**Cultural Memory Lab Weekly Update #11**

Hi everyone\!

Thanks for joining us yesterday for the IPFS \+ Storacha workshop yesterday (and thanks to Eli for putting together our very helpful [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LkLITy9LSRZOWqqQ8mflZ4Y61YWmkZKfx5XQtZBKVZg/edit?usp=sharing)\!) Missed the workshop or want to review it? [Hereâ€™s the recording](https://youtu.be/sNWwh7Es2iw).

Weâ€™ll see you all again **tomorrow, June 13, at 9am PST** for another technical workshop with Ian Davis from FFDW. Zoom link [here](https://techsoupglobal.zoom.us/j/5047418521)\!

Congrats on completing the DWeb for Creators Course\! To celebrate everything youâ€™ve learned and built, weâ€™ll be hosting a DWeb for Creators Project Salon on **Wednesday, June 18, 10amâ€“1pm PT**. Even if you wonâ€™t be presenting during the salon, I encourage you to tune in to see what your fellow classmates have been working on. RSVP [here](https://grayarea.org/event/dweb-for-creators-project-salon/) for the Zoom link. 

Finally, I wanted to pass along a call for applications to the [Data Values Advocates Program](https://gpsdd.smapply.us/prog/datavalues_advocates_program/), which will provide training, mentorship, microgrants and support to four grassroots and community activists who are interested in promoting and implementing the [Data Values Manifesto](https://www.data4sdgs.org/datavaluesproject). Selected activists will receive a stipend, gain access to workshops and mentorship, and an opportunity to attend the 2026 Global Data Festival in Nairobi, Kenya\!

See you all during tomorrowâ€™s workshop\!
