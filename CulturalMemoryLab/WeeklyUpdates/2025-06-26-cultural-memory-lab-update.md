**Cultural Memory Lab Weekly Update #12**

Hi everyone\!

Thanks again to those of you who shared your work during the DWeb for Creators Project Salon â€” it was great to learn more about what you all accomplished during the course\! Be on the lookout for a survey from the Gray Area team asking you to share more about your experience during the DWeb course. 

As this inaugural cohort of the Cultural Memory Lab wraps up (time flies\!), Eli, Billy, and I want to ensure that we can continue to share the impact of your work beyond the Lab period. Toward that end, Iâ€™ve reached out to each team individually about an exciting Cultural Memory Lab video project weâ€™re working on. Please let me know how youâ€™d like to participate in this project\!

Thatâ€™s all for now; weâ€™ll be back in touch this time next week with some final steps as we close out this Cultural Memory Lab cohort.

â€“ The Cultural Memory Lab Team ðŸ’™
