**Cultural Memory Lab Weekly Update #10**

Hi Cultural Memory Lab-ers,

We’re heading into the final phase of the Lab — and it’s time to get hands-on with IPFS\! Over the next two weeks, we’ll equip you with the tools, guidance, and support to start uploading your collections to decentralized storage. Expect two practical workshops, a new how-to guide, and one-on-one follow-up to help you experiment with decentralized storage.

Scroll down for everything you need to know about the June 11 and 13 sessions — and what you’ll want to prep ahead of time\!

### **Your Guide to IPFS \+ Storacha\!**

🗓️ *Wednesday, June 11 at 8 AM Pacific*

Next week, we’ll release a step-by-step guide to help you upload your first files to decentralized storage using Storacha and IPFS. This hands-on resource will walk you through the entire process — from preparing your files to generating shareable links for your website or archive.

To help you get started, we’re hosting a **live workshop on June 11** to explore the guide together and answer your questions.

**Get ready:**

Before the session, please collect a few sample archival items you’d like to test with (e.g., images, documents, transcripts) and draft a short ReadMe file describing the contents. We’ll be using your real materials during the session.

I’ll also follow up with each project lead individually to determine which materials are a good fit for the decentralized storage pilot.

Keep an eye on your inbox for the guide release and calendar invite — it should already be there\!
