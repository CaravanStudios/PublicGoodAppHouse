**Subject: Cultural Memory Lab Weekly Update #9**


Hi Cultural Memory Lab-ers,

We’re heading into the final phase of the Lab — and it’s time to get hands-on with IPFS\! Over the next two weeks, we’ll equip you with the tools, guidance, and support to start uploading your collections to decentralized storage. Expect two practical workshops, a new how-to guide, and one-on-one follow-up to help you experiment with decentralized storage.

Scroll down for everything you need to know about the June 11 and 13 sessions — and what you’ll want to prep ahead of time\!

### **Your Guide to IPFS \+ Storacha\!**

🗓️ *Wednesday, June 11 at 8 AM Pacific*

Next week, we’ll release a step-by-step guide to help you upload your first files to decentralized storage using Storacha and IPFS. This hands-on resource will walk you through the entire process — from preparing your files to generating shareable links for your website or archive.

To help you get started, we’re hosting a **live workshop on June 11** to explore the guide together and answer your questions.

**Get ready:**

Before the session, please collect a few sample archival items you’d like to test with (e.g., images, documents, transcripts) and draft a short ReadMe file describing the contents. We’ll be using your real materials during the session.

I’ll also follow up with each project lead individually to determine which materials are a good fit for the decentralized storage pilot.

Keep an eye on your inbox for the guide release and calendar invite — it should already be there\!

### **Technical Workshop: Filecoin/IPFS with Ian Davis**

🗓️ *Friday, June 13 at 9 AM Pacific*

Join Ian Davis from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web for a second hands-on technical workshop tailored to Cultural Memory Lab cohort members. This session is your chance to dig deep and troubleshoot any remaining challenges with your archiving project.

Next week is also the *final* week of the DWeb for Creators Course.

**DWeb’s Social and Community Impact with Sarah Grant**

In this session, we’ll explore DWeb’s social, community, and non-technical dimensions. We’ll discuss mesh networks and their emergent potential, then dive into world-building, speculative design, and futurism through exercises that visualize future scenarios enabled by DWeb.

**Praxis Session: DWeb Worldbuilding \+ Speculative Design with Ayana Zaire Cotton**

Synthesizing the concepts we’ve explored throughout this DWeb series, Ayana invites you to leverage the power of worldbuilding. Now that we understand both the critiques and possibilities of DWeb, what world do we want to build in response?

Travel to Cykofa — a speculative world of decolonial aesthetics suspended between past and future. Learn to imagine, speculate, and design your own parallel universe, where decentralization is an ancient reality. Explore expansive visions of decentralization that go far beyond hardware or computer interfaces.

**Enjoy the rest of your week\!**
