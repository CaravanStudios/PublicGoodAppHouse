# 🗂️ Weekly Cultural Memory Lab Cohort Updates

Welcome to the archive of weekly email updates for the **Cultural Memory Lab** cohort. This folder contains each Thursday’s email, documenting key milestones, upcoming events, action items, and surprise opportunities shared with our community of decentralized memory-keepers.

These updates serve as a historical record of the Cultural Memory Lab’s progression and community engagement. They are written with care to inform, inspire, and connect our global cohort of GLAM practitioners, technologists, and cultural stewards.

## 📬 About the Weekly Update

The **weekly email** is our primary method of communication with the cohort. Each edition is sent **every Thursday** and includes:

* 3 key updates or calls to action
* 1 delightful or unexpected “surprise” resource or opportunity  
* Practical links and reminders to keep projects on track  
* Notes of encouragement and connection from the Lab team

You can think of it as a weekly postcard from your extended DWeb community.

## ✍️ How the Emails Are Created
