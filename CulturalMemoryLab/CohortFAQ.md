# Cultural Memory Lab: Cohort FAQs

## TechSoup, Gray Area, and Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web

*The Cultural Memory Lab is an incubator empowering community-based archives, libraries, museums, and other cultural organizations to explore decentralized strategies for preserving collective memory.*

### About the Program

**Gray Area**, [**TechSoup**](https://www.techsoup.org/), and the [**Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web**](https://ffdweb.org/) have teamed up to launch the **Cultural Memory Lab**, an incubator and microgranting program that seeks to sustain publicly accessible digital archives. The Cultural Memory Lab invited organizations from around the world to propose a project that leverages decentralized technologies to preserve stories historically excluded from archival practices. Selected projects will receive up to $5,000 in funding, access to Gray Area’s DWeb for Creators course, and dedicated technical support from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. 

### Cultural Memory Lab Experience

Selected via open call, 3–5 projects will receive between **$2,000 to $5,000** in funding, enabling teams to explore inventive applications of decentralized technologies in their ongoing cultural memory work. To further support such experimentation, project teams will participate in **mentorship** sessions with advisors from the [**FFDW**](https://ffdweb.org/). Additionally, Cultural Memory Lab participants will gain access to Gray Area’s [**DWeb for Creators course**](https://grayarea.org/course/dweb-for-creators/), an 8-week facilitated course offering theoretical frameworks, perspectives, tools, and other resources to catalyze creative approaches to decentralized tool-building.  

The Cultural Memory Lab will run for four months, from April to June 2025. All project teams will meet virtually for cohort-wide check-ins at the beginning, mid-point, and end of the lab period. A **final summer showcase** will give teams the opportunity to demonstrate their work to a broad audience.
