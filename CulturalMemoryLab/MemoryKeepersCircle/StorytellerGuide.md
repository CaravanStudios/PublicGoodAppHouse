# **Storyteller Guide: Memory Keepers Circle, The Space Between \- May 2025**

Dear XXX,

Thank you for agreeing to share your story in our upcoming Memory Keepers Circle on Wednesday, May 21 at 8:00 am pacific.

## **Your Role as Storyteller**

As a storyteller, you'll have about 7 minutes to share a personal story related to our theme: **The Space Between.** 

This isn't a presentation or analysis â€“ it's a story from your experience that others will simply witness.

## **The Theme: The Space Between**

This circle explores the tensions and challenges of standing between past and future systems in our preservation work. 

Consider:

* A moment when you felt caught between analog and digital worlds  
* Something valuable you had to let go of to embrace new technologies  
* A cultural memory you worry might fall through the cracks  
* A decision point where you had to navigate competing values in preservation  
* A time when you felt the gap between what could be saved and what should be saved

Your story doesn't need to resolve neatly. Sometimes the most powerful sharing comes from the questions we're still living.

## **Guidelines for Your Story**

1. **Be specific and personal.** Share a particular moment or experience, not general thoughts on the theme.  
2. **Speak in your own voice.** Simple, direct language often carries more truth than polished presentation.  
3. **Trust the silence.** You don't need to fill every moment with words. Pauses allow meaning to settle.  
4. **You decide what to share.** Only go as deep as feels right for you.  
5. **No need for context-setting.** Jump straight into your story rather than explaining the background.  
6. **This isn't a performance.** You're not being evaluated. The power of the format is in authentic sharing.

## **What to Expect**

* You'll share for about 7 minutes  
* The facilitator may give a gentle signal when you're approaching time  
* After you finish, there will be a brief silence  
* Each witness will offer a single sentence beginning with, *What I witnessed was...*  
* No one will question, advise, or connect back to their own experience

## **Preparation**

The best preparation is simple reflection. Consider setting aside 20 minutes before the circle to sit quietly with these questions:

* What moment in my work exists in the space between old and new systems?  
* What tensions, losses, or challenges have I navigated?  
* What truth about this experience might serve others to hear?

Trust that whatever story comes forward is the right one.

## **Circle Format Reminder**

One person speaks. Everyone else witnesses. No fixing. No advice. Just presence.

The circle is scheduled for Wednesday, May 21 at 8:00 am pacific. Please arrive 5 minutes early to settle in.

If you have any questions before the circle, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your willingness to share. Your story matters.

Warmly, XXXX
