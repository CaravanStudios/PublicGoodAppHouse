# **Memory Keepers Circle**

*A Wednesday Effect Experience for The Cultural Memory Lab May-June 2025*

## **INTERNAL PROCESS DOCUMENT**

### **What We're Doing**

We're running three circles for the Cultural Memory Lab cohort. Simple format. One person speaks. The rest listen. No fixing. No advice. Just presence.

I've seen this work before. People think it won't matter until they're in it. Then something shifts.

Our people work with technical systems all day. They solve storage problems, build protocols, and migrate formats. What they don't do is talk about why. 

This gives them that space.

### **Timeline**

* *Buy-in from first storytellers:* Friday, May 2, 2025  
* **Circle One: Origins & Artifacts**: Wednesday, May 7, 2025 (8am Pacific)  
* **Circle Two: Liminality & Loss**: TBD (mid-May)  
* **Circle Three: Stewardship & Legacy**: TBD (early June)


## Attendee Invitation

### Send this message once we have our first storytellers:

*In the spaces between our technical discussions, I'm offering something different. A chance to share the human stories behind your preservation work.*

*Next Wednesday during our community workshop, I'm hosting a Memory Keepers Circle. Simple format: a few people share brief stories about their connection to this work. The rest of us witness. No advice-giving. No problem-solving.*

*This is optional. If you'd rather use that time differently, that's fine.*

*I need 2-3 people willing to share a brief story (about 7 minutes) on this question: What artifact or memory first awakened your commitment to preservation work?*

*Let me know privately if you'll share. Come just to witness if you prefer.*


### **Setting Up the Space**

**Virtual setup:**

* Everyone on camera if possible  
* Headphones recommended  
* Private space if they can manage it  
* Gallery view so all faces are visible

### **Running the Circle**

Start simply:

*Thank you for being here. What we're about to do might feel different. It's meant to.*

*We spend most of our time solving technical problems. Today, we're creating space for the human stories behind that work.*

*Two people will share a brief story about what first drew them to preservation work. Each speaks for about seven minutes. The rest of us just listen. No questions. No advice. No connecting it back to ourselves. Just witnessing.*

*After each story, we'll sit in silence for a minute. Then each person offers a single sentence that begins with 'What I witnessed was...' Not what we liked or what resonated, just what we saw or heard or felt.*

*That's it. One person speaks at a time. No interrupting. No fixing. No advice.*

*This isn't mandatory. If you'd prefer to step out, that's fine.*

*Who would like to begin?*

### **Your Role as Facilitator**

Keep it minimal:

* Hold the container  
* Step in gently if someone starts giving advice  
* Watch the time without being rigid  
* Protect the storyteller's space  
* Model the witness response \- be first to say "What I witnessed was..."  
* Don't make it about you  
* Let silences be silences

### **Between Circles**

Send a brief note after the first circle:

*Thank you to those who joined our Memory Keepers Circle today. What happens in the circle stays there, but the connections formed continue.*

*We'll hold one more circle in about a month (specific date). The theme will be 'The Space Between' \- stories about navigating the tension between old and new systems, what gets lost in transition, and the choices that keep you up at night.*

*If you'd like to share a story next time, please let me know. If you missed this one but are curious, you're welcome to join, either as storyteller or witness*.

### **For the Second Circle**

Send this invitation:

*Our next Memory Keepers Circle is approaching (date/time). Several people mentioned how valuable the first circle was \- not as another technical discussion, but as a rare space to connect around why we do this work.*

*This circle explores 'The Space Between' \- the tensions of standing between past and future systems, what falls through the cracks, and how we navigate these gaps.*

*Participation is optional but welcomed. If you'd like to share a story on this theme, let me know.*

### **If We Meet Resistance**

Some people will resist this format. That's fine. Don't push.

The invitation stays open. Those who need it will come. Those who don't, won't.

The power is in the simplicity. Trust it.

# **Memory Keepers: A Wednesday Effect Experience**

**A Circle Journey for Cultural Memory Guardians**

What if the most valuable asset in decentralized web archiving isn't the technology, but the humans who steward it?

This circle experience brings together our cohort of community archivists working where cultural memory meets decentralized technologies. Through structured storytelling and witnessed reflection, we'll explore the personal dimensions of our work as memory keepers.

Each 45-minute circle follows the Wednesday Protocol—a method that creates safety, connection, and insight when navigating complex transitions.

One person speaks. The group witnesses. No fixing. No advice. Just presence.

What emerges is anything but simple.

## **The Impact**

When archivists gather this way, something happens. Technical challenges reveal their human dimensions. Individual struggles find resonance in shared experience. Preservation becomes not just a technological problem but a human story we're writing together.

This is a chance to be fully seen in your work, to tell the true story of what it means to preserve cultural memory in a decentralized future, and to discover that the most important technology may be the spaces we create for authentic connection.

## **Our Circle Journey**

### **Circle One: Origins & Artifacts \- May 7, 2025 (8am Pacific)**

**Exploring our relationship with what we preserve**

We begin with stories that brought us to this work.

* *What artifact or memory first awakened your commitment to preservation?*  
* *What personal connection drives your work with cultural memory?*  
* *How has your relationship with "what matters" evolved as technology has transformed?*

This opening circle establishes our container while exploring the origins of our calling as archivists.

### **Circle Two: Liminality & Loss \- TBD**

**Navigating the space between preservation and transformation**

All archival work exists in tension between preserving the past and creating the future. We'll share stories of inhabiting this in-between space.

* *When have you felt caught between analog and digital worlds?*  
* *What have you had to let go of to embrace decentralized technologies?*  
* *What cultural memories haunt you as potentially being left behind?*

This middle circle explores the neutral zone—the uncomfortable but fertile space where old maps no longer work but new ones haven't fully formed.

### **Circle Three: Stewardship & Legacy \- TBD**

**Claiming our role in the future of memory**

In our final circle, we turn toward integration and forward motion.

* *What story would you tell about the future impact of your work?*  
* *How do you see your role evolving as a guardian of cultural memory?*  
* *What becomes possible when we fully embrace our responsibility as stewards?*

This closing circle helps crystallize insights and catalyze commitment to our evolving identity as dweb archivists.

## **What Happens in a Circle?**

The room goes quiet. Someone begins to speak. Not about specs or storage solutions, but about what matters, what's being saved and what might be lost.

The rest listen. Really listen.

That's it.

Except something changes afterwards.

**Participation is entirely voluntary.**

If you'd like to share a story in our first circle on May 7th, please reach out privately. If you'd prefer to simply witness, you're equally welcome.

The only requirement: being present, with cameras on if possible.

Sometimes the most important work happens not in the solving of problems, but in the sharing of why we came to solve them in the first place.
