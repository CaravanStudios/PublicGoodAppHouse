# **Event Description: Introducing GLAM Organizations to the Decentralized Web and Storage**

*Alternate title: Decentralized Futures: Revolutionizing Cultural Preservation for GLAM Organizations*

Discover how decentralized storage can transform the preservation and accessibility of cultural assets in this engaging workshop series for Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM). Hosted by \[PARTNER NAME\] in collaboration with TechSoup and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web, this event connects cultural organizations with cutting-edge tools and knowledge to empower their work in the digital age.

## **Why Decentralized Storage Matters for GLAM**

Cultural institutions face mounting challenges in safeguarding digital collections, from ensuring long-term accessibility to protecting data against obsolescence and centralization risks. Decentralized storage offers a groundbreaking alternative that addresses these challenges through:

* **Immutability and Permanence**: Safeguard cultural data with tamper-proof systems and guarantee provenance in an era of AI-generated slop.  
* **Community Ownership**: Empower cultural organizations to maintain control over their digital assets, fostering shared stewardship and ethical management of cultural heritage.

* **Transparency**: Build trust with verifiable data history and open systems.  
* **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduce reliance on costly centralized storage solutions with affordable, scalable technologies.  
* **Redundancy**: Avoid single points of failure with distributed networks that ensure resilience.  
* **Innovation and Experimentation**: Explore new possibilities for collaborative archiving and digital preservation.

## **What You'll Learn**

Participants will gain:

* A foundational understanding of decentralized storage technologies like IPFS and Filecoin.  
* Insights into how these tools address specific challenges in cultural preservation.  
* Practical knowledge through case studies and examples and implementation examples.  
* Opportunities to collaborate and share resources with peers in the GLAM sector.
