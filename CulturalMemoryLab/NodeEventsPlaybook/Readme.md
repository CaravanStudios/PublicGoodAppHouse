# DWeb Nodes Event Playbook

## Overview

Welcome to the **DWeb Nodes Event Playbook**, a community-driven resource developed by TechSoup in partnership with Gray Area and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW). This folder provides templates, timelines, and promotional tools for civil society organizations—especially those working with GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums)—to host public events on decentralized storage and the broader decentralized web (DWeb).

These materials support the **Cultural Memory Lab**, a global initiative offering microgrants and technical assistance to community archives preserving underrepresented histories. Our goal: equip local partners with everything they need to spark curiosity, build capacity, and connect GLAM institutions to the DWeb community.
