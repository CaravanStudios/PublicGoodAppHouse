#### **Full Workshop Description**

As AI reshapes how we handle data, nonprofits face growing challenges in ensuring their digital assets remain secure, accessible, and free from centralized control. That’s why we created this workshop on **data sovereignty for galleries, libraries, arts organizations, archives, museums, and special collections (GLAM).**

In **“Preserving Digital Assets: Hands-On with Decentralized Storage,”** you'll gain practical skills and confidence in using decentralized tools to safeguard your organization's digital heritage. This session is tailored for nonprofits that are concerned about data sovereignty and want to reduce risks tied to centralized storage, such as censorship, external control, or authenticity.

Participants will:

* Understand the fundamentals of decentralized storage and its benefits for GLAM institutions.  
* Get hands-on experience with tools like **storacha.network**, an intuitive platform for uploading files to IPFS and Filecoin.  
* Learn step-by-step techniques for uploading, retrieving, and sharing digital assets with decentralized storage solutions.

With live demonstrations, guided hands-on activities, and a focus on practical applications, this workshop equips you with the tools to protect and preserve your organization’s digital assets.

Whether you're new to digital preservation or looking to enhance your strategies, this workshop is for you. No technical background is required—just a commitment to data sovereignty and protecting your organization's valuable digital resources.

Join us to explore how decentralized technologies can empower nonprofits to take control of their data and build resilience for the future.
