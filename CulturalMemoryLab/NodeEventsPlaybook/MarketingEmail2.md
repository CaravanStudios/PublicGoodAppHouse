**Subject:** Join Us\! Hands-On Workshop on Decentralized Storage for Archivists

**Dear \[Recipient’s Name\],**

As AI transforms data management, how can nonprofits in the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) ensure their digital assets remain secure, accessible, and free from centralized control?

Join us for a practical workshop designed to help GLAM institutions explore decentralized storage solutions and take control of their digital heritage.

Note: This workshop builds on our prior workshop on decentralized technologies, but each event is standalone and attendance at both is not necessary.
