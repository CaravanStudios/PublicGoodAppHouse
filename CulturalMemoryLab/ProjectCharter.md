# Project Charter: Empowering GLAM Makers & Institutions through Innovative Memory Projects

**Start Date**: September 21, 2024  
**End Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Report Due Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Budget**: XXX

TechSoup, in collaboration with Greyarea.org and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW), proposes to catalyze partnerships between DWeb leaders and Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums (GLAM) institutions by facilitating the co-creation of groundbreaking "Cultural Memory Projects" that leverage decentralized technologies. 

The initiative is designed to empower GLAM Makers and institutions to preserve and share underrepresented histories, challenge dominant narratives, and promote a more inclusive understanding of our collective past.

By working closely with a targeted network of 3-5 GLAM Makers, we will support the adoption of decentralized technologies like Filecoin and IPFS to preserve and share underrepresented histories, challenge dominant narratives, and promote a more inclusive understanding of our collective past. The resulting Memory Projects will serve as powerful proof points to inspire further adoption, demonstrating the impact of decentralized technologies in the cultural heritage sector.

The unique combination of technical expertise, creative vision, historical resources, and DWeb technology this collaboration pulls together will create an environment where GLAM Makers are empowered to democratize local histories,ensure long-term accessibility, and create a more inclusive, resilient, and engaging civil society.

# Key Stakeholders, Roles

_List of the core working team_


## **Issue Escalation & Resolution**

If issues are identified they should be elevated to the Project Manager who will determine the resolution. If Project Manager needs support, they will bring the issue to the Executive Sponsor. For the most sensitive issues, the Program Director and Sponsor will elevate items to FFDW for inputs and guidance. 

## **Risk monitoring and control**

The project’s risks will be monitored on a weekly basis during the team’s weekly call. The Project Manager will determine if a critical risk has emerged, and will address it. If a major risk emerges that doesn’t have a simple fix, the Project Manager will determine the best course of action in conversation with the Executive Sponsor, and FFDW as appropriate.

## **Quality control**

To ensure quality of outputs, the Project Manager will work on setting the general scope, approach and tone for the essential project components, how they work together, and how communications works within the team, among community participants, and with FFDW. The Executive Sponsor will review and approve all published materials and/or deliverables. Approval is required for all public communications. Approval is not required for everyday communications like 1:1 emails. The Executive Sponsor will serve as the lead communicator and/or facilitator on community events, to establish a structure and rhythm for the program. As the structure and rhythm takes shape, the Project Manager will distribute community communications and facilitation to appropriate facilitators. 

## **Project Closure Process**

When the project has been completed the following will need to be done:

* Archiving of key assets by the Grant Delivery Manager  
* Publishing of major outputs with FFDW, TechSoup Network and internal TechSoup staff  
* A final report will be written and delivered to FFDW   
* A point-person will be assigned to address any post-project questions from project participants and partners

## **Approval of Project Charter**

The project charter governs the scope and budget of the project. Therefore substantial changes to the project scope require the approval of the Program Director and Executive Sponsor. However, minor changes, like changes of dates to key milestones that don’t interfere with the overall project timeline or end date, will only need approval by the Program Director. 

**Project Governance**  
This project will be governed by regular check-ins between the Project Team and the Executive Sponsor.

## **Invoicing**

Invoicing to TechSoup will follow the process outlined in our contract agreement.
