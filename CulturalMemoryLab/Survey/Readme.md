# Exploring Decentralized Storage Readiness in GLAM Organizations

In late 2024, TechSoup and partners conducted a targeted survey of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) to assess their awareness, challenges, and readiness to adopt decentralized storage technologies such as Filecoin and IPFS. This initiative aimed to better understand the digital preservation needs of civil society memory institutions and to identify where support could have the greatest impact. The survey reached out to organizations with an existing interest in decentralized technologies or a public digital archive, resulting in 24 qualified responses that offer a unique glimpse into the current state of adoption and aspiration in the field.

## Organizational Identity and Structure

Respondents represented a wide spectrum of GLAM institutions:
* Libraries were the most represented group, followed by archives, galleries, and museums.
* Several organizations identified as operating with hybrid missions—delivering both services and grantmaking, or simply describing themselves as "Other."

This diversity in structure reflects the flexible and often interdisciplinary nature of GLAM organizations, especially smaller institutions that wear many hats.

**Insight:** Decentralized storage solutions must be adaptable to a variety of organizational contexts—from service-focused community libraries to collections-focused archives.

## Digital Archive Presence and Purpose

* About half of respondents manage a public digital archive.
* The primary purposes cited for these archives were:
  * Historical preservation
  * Educational access
  * Community engagement and storytelling

**Insight:** GLAM organizations are not archiving for compliance or administrative reasons alone—they are stewards of community memory. Any storage solution must support narrative and interpretive access, not just file hosting.

## Key Challenges to Access and Sustainability

Respondents identified multiple pain points related to maintaining digital archives:
* Data loss and backup concerns
* Difficulty using current tools
* Lack of technical expertise
* High storage costs
* Worries about losing control when working with large tech vendors

**Insight:** The appetite for decentralized storage is not just about innovation—it's a response to real frustrations with fragility, affordability, and autonomy in digital infrastructure.

## Awareness and Current Use of Decentralized Storage

* Just under half of respondents were familiar with decentralized technologies like Filecoin, IPFS, or LOCKSS.
* Very few organizations currently use decentralized storage, but a number expressed interest in learning more.

**Insight:** Awareness is still limited, but openness is high. There's a clear opportunity for capacity-building and community education.

## Perceived Benefits and Risks

Respondents saw strong potential in decentralized storage, especially in:
* Enhancing data security and privacy
* Reducing dependency on major tech platforms
* Increasing redundancy and access

At the same time, concerns were voiced around:
* Technical complexity
* Cost predictability
* Integration with existing systems

**Insight:** The benefits of decentralized storage resonate with core values of GLAM organizations—autonomy, accessibility, preservation. However, adoption will require technical guidance and reassurance around long-term sustainability.

## Appetite for Support and Community

Interest in future engagement was strong:
* Most respondents said they would like to be notified about upcoming trainings or workshops
* A majority would consider joining a supported cohort to explore decentralized storage in more depth
* Some organizations remain uncertain, signaling the need for clear case studies and low-barrier pilot opportunities

**Insight:** The GLAM sector is curious and cautious—ready to explore, but looking for structured, trusted support. They are more likely to adopt new systems in a community setting than in isolation.

## Conclusion

This survey reinforces what we’ve heard anecdotally: GLAM institutions are deeply invested in the preservation and accessibility of community memory, and they are actively seeking more sustainable, ethical, and resilient digital infrastructure. While decentralized storage is still emerging within the sector, there is significant potential for uptake—especially if onboarding includes peer support, storytelling, and alignment with mission-driven goals.

TechSoup and our partners are committed to bridging the gap between decentralized technology and the cultural sector. Whether through hands-on workshops, exploratory cohorts, or toolkits for implementation, we’re building the pathways that allow these vital organizations to preserve the past with the technologies of the future.
