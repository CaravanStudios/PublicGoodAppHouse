# GLAM Institutions and Decentralized Storage: What the Data Tells Us

In late 2024, TechSoup and partners conducted a survey of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) to understand their awareness, needs, and readiness around decentralized storage technologies like Filecoin and IPFS. The survey gathered 24 qualified responses from GLAM organizations with a public-facing mission, many of whom manage or are exploring digital archives.

This document shares a data-informed look at their current state of adoption, perceived barriers, and appetite for support.

## Who We Heard From

Participants represented a range of institution types:

* **Libraries** — 63%
* **Archives** — 25%
* **Museums** — 29%
* **Galleries** — 4%

In terms of organizational structure:

* **Libraries** — 50%
* **Program-delivering orgs** — 25%
* **Other** — 17%
* **Hybrid orgs or research-focused** — 8%

**Insight:** Most respondents come from public or service-oriented institutions, with a strong lean toward libraries. This suggests that outreach for decentralized storage should prioritize libraries while adapting to the needs of mixed-model GLAM orgs.

## Who Has a Digital Archive?

* **79%** of respondents said their organization **manages a public digital archive**
* **21%** do not currently maintain one

Among those with archives, the primary stated purposes were:

* **Historical preservation** — 68%
* **Educational resource** — 21%
* **Community engagement or other** — 11%

**Insight:** The dominant role of archives in historical preservation reinforces the need for durable, trustworthy storage solutions. Any new system must ensure long-term integrity and access.

## Familiarity with Decentralized Storage

When asked about decentralized technologies like Filecoin, IPFS, or LOCKSS:

* **17%** are already familiar  
* **33%** are **not familiar, but interested in learning more**  
* **50%** are **not familiar at all**

Current usage of decentralized storage:

* **Yes** — 17%  
* **No, but interested** — 17%  
* **No** — 66%

**Insight:** While awareness is low, curiosity is high. Education and capacity-building remain the most urgent next steps.

---

## Perceived Challenges and Needs

Common pain points identified in managing digital archives include:

* **Data loss or backup issues**
* **Lack of technical expertise**
* **Tool usability problems**
* **Storage costs**
* **Concerns over vendor lock-in**

**Insight:** GLAM institutions are already experiencing the limitations of centralized systems. Decentralized solutions could offer both resilience and autonomy—if implementation hurdles are addressed.

## Appetite for Support and Community-Based Adoption

When asked about interest in structured support from TechSoup and its partners:

* **Yes** — 35%  
* **Uncertain** — 41%  
* **No** — 24%

When asked about joining a private cohort:

* **Yes** — 6%  
* **Uncertain** — 65%  
* **No** — 29%

When asked if they'd like to be notified about future workshops:

* **Yes** — 94%  
* **No** — 6%

**Insight:** Light-touch engagement like workshops and community calls are highly welcome. Organizations are not yet ready for high-commitment programs—but many are warming up to the idea.

---

## Willingness to Stay Engaged

* **88%** of organizations are open to follow-up conversations

**Insight:** There is strong goodwill and openness to further learning. This gives us a foundation for relationship-building and long-term collaboration.

## Conclusion: Education, Trust, and Timing Are Key

This survey shows that GLAM institutions care deeply about digital preservation and are looking for alternatives to centralized, commercial cloud storage. While only a small portion currently use decentralized storage, a majority are open to learning more—and many are eager for resources and support.

The path forward includes:

* Building introductory workshops  
* Sharing real-world case studies  
* Offering low-barrier cohort opportunities  
* Supporting peer learning and storytelling

By doing so, we can empower GLAMs to preserve cultural memory using technology that aligns with their values.
