# **Cultural Memory Lab Guide: Uploading Public Collections to IPFS with Storacha.network**

The **Cultural Memory Lab** supports community archives, libraries, and cultural organizations in preserving shared histories using decentralized technologies. By leveraging tools like **IPFS** and **Filecoin**, we help participants make their public collections accessible, resilient, and independent of centralized platforms.

This guide walks you through how to prepare, upload, and share your first folder using  [Storacha.network](https://storacha.network), a beginner-friendly service for publishing to the IPFS network.

**Goal**: Upload at least **20 non-sensitive, public files** from your collection to decentralized storage.

## **üß∞ What You'll Learn**

* How to prepare and organize your files for decentralized storage  
* What types of files are appropriate for IPFS ‚Äî and which to avoid  
* How to write a `README.md` file with helpful metadata and context  
* How to upload your folder using Storacha and generate a CID  
* How to share IPFS links generated by IPFS gateways on your website or project page  
* How to explain your use of IPFS to different audiences  
* Why decentralized storage is only one part of a resilient backup strategy

---

## **1\. Prepare Your Files for Upload**

Choose a small collection (aim for 20\) of non-sensitive files. Ideally, this comes from your existing archives; however, if you don‚Äôt yet have enough suitable materials, you can create a sample folder instead. 

Good examples include:

* Public domain images or scans  
* Workshop notes or zines  
* Sample datasets  
* Oral history transcripts (publicly shareable)

üõë Avoid uploading:

* Personal or sensitive data  
* Copyrighted content you don‚Äôt have permission to share  
* Files that may need to be edited or removed later

üìÅ Organize all files into one folder. You will upload this collection.

---

---

## **2\. Create a `README.md` File**

Inside your folder, add a file called `README.md`. This should be a **plain text file** formatted using [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Markdown makes it easy to include headings, bullet points, and simple formatting that is readable both as raw text and on the web.

Clearly describing the contents of your folder is a key archival best practice. A well-written README file serves as a guide to your materials, offering essential context that supports long-term access and meaningful interpretation.

Think of the README as a digital cover letter for your archive: it introduces the collection, outlines its purpose, and documents important metadata. The file helps future users ‚Äî including community members, researchers, and archivists ‚Äî understand what they're looking at and why it matters.

Good README files often include:

* A project description and scope  
* Key dates and contributors  
* A list of included files with titles, authors, and summaries  
* Any usage rights or access restrictions

By following a consistent structure, you help ensure your archive is accessible and comprehensible, no matter who encounters it or when.

At a minimum, your ReadMe file should include:

* Project title and short description  
* Who created the files (e.g., your organization or lab team)  
* Date of creation or upload  
* Any relevant rights/license information (e.g., CC BY 4.0)  
* Contact info (optional)

Example:

```

## **3\. Upload to Storacha.network**

By using Storacha, your files will be uploaded to the IPFS network and made accessible through an **IPFS gateway** ‚Äî a web-based tool that allows anyone to view and download IPFS content through a standard browser. This means your files can be opened without needing special software or a technical background. Gateways bridge the gap between decentralized networks and everyday web users.

There are many tools and services you can use to upload files to IPFS and Filecoin. We recommend starting with [Storacha.network](https://storacha.network/) because it's simple, beginner-friendly, and doesn‚Äôt require downloading special software.

This step will generate a unique **CID (Content Identifier)** for your folder. CIDs act like permanent, verifiable web addresses. You can link to these CIDs from your website, emails, or project documentation ‚Äî making your files accessible to anyone with a browser, even if they‚Äôve never used IPFS before.

If you'd like to explore your IPFS content beyond browser gateways, you can use IPFS Desktop ‚Äî a free, open-source tool that makes it easy to manage and share files from your own IPFS node.

1. Go to [Storacha.network](https://storacha.network) and click ***Start Storing***![][image1]  
2. Enter your email to verify your account![][image2]  
3. Click the verification link in your inbox ![][image3]  
4. Select the Starter plan and click ***Subscribe***![][image4]  
5. Add a payment method ‚Äî **you won‚Äôt be charged** unless you go over the free 5 GB (this is very unlikely for 20 files, but you should double check the size of the files you are uploading to be certain).  
     ![][image5]  
6. Create a new *Space (we recommend your project name)* ![][image6]![][image7]  
7. Upload your folder (not just individual files)![][image8]  
1. Click ***Upload***  
2. Select Directory (if you‚Äôre uploading a folder, rather than an individual file)  
3. Add your folder  
4. Click ***Start Upload***  
5. To to UPLOADS to see your folder  
8. Storacha will return a **CID** (Content Identifier for the folder)![][image9]  
9. Click the URL to open the Gateway, a webpage that can be accessed by any browser, making your files on IPFS and Filecoin accessible to those unfamiliar with IPFS.![][image10]  
10. You can either share the folder OR individual files, which will have their own CIDs.  
11. To retrieve the IPFS gateway link for any of your individual files, right click and select ***Copy Link Address**.*  
12. Now that you have your IPFS gateway link you can add it to your existing websites or storage platforms.

## **4\. Add Links to Your Website or Project Page**

You can use your IPFS gateway links anywhere you'd use a normal URL ‚Äî embed them in project documentation, digital exhibitions, or blog posts.

Many people are not yet familiar with CIDs or IPFS, so it's helpful to include a short explanation alongside your links. This helps build understanding and trust with your audience, and provides context for why you're using decentralized storage.

For guidance, check the next section ‚Äî ‚ÄúWrite Your Own Why‚Äù ‚Äî which includes example blurbs tailored for different audiences.

Example:

```html
<a href="https://bafybeibwzif7e6spqdlvsjqdjz5pgibufp63rj3z3axlzftscs3gnjqb4u.ipfs.w3s.link/">View the files on IPFS</a>
```

---

## **5\. Write Your Own Why**

Decentralized storage can feel technical ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also deeply values-driven. To help others understand your choice, consider drafting a short explanation:

**Prompts:**

* What does digital permanence mean to you?  
* Why is it important that these files are accessible outside of centralized systems?  
* How does IPFS align with your goals of equity, transparency, or community ownership?

### **Sample Language You Can Use**

Here are example blurbs you can copy or adapt for your website, project documentation, or exhibitions:

**üßµ Short & Friendly**

This file is stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized network designed to preserve and share digital content reliably and long-term.

**üåê Website Blurb**

We‚Äôve archived this project on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) ‚Äî a decentralized, peer-to-peer file storage network. Unlike traditional websites, files on IPFS are accessible as long as one person in the network continues to share them. That means even if our main site goes offline, this content remains available.

**üìö Preservation Statement**

This project is preserved using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and Filecoin to ensure long-term access and resilience. We chose decentralized storage to reduce reliance on any single platform or server, and to support global access ‚Äî especially in regions with censorship or connectivity challenges.

**üõ† Technical Rationale**

IPFS offers content-addressable storage, meaning each file is identified by a unique cryptographic hash (CID). This ensures the integrity of the data over time. Paired with Filecoin‚Äôs blockchain-based incentives, our storage is distributed, verifiable, and designed to persist independently of institutional hosting.

**üåç Values-Driven**

Decentralized storage reflects our values: equity, autonomy, and access. By archiving our work on IPFS, we‚Äôre joining a movement to build digital infrastructure that resists takedowns, enables community stewardship, and supports long-term memory for underrepresented stories.

## **5\. Next Steps on Your Journey**

Decentralized storage represents an exciting new approach to safeguarding our cultural memory ‚Äî one that puts ownership and access in the hands of communities. By using IPFS and Filecoin, you‚Äôre helping to shape a more resilient, inclusive, and participatory future for archiving.

This guide is just the beginning. As a member of the Cultural Memory Lab, you'll receive continued support as you explore these tools and contribute to a growing network of peer-led experimentation. Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out with questions, share what you‚Äôre learning, or invite feedback from others in the cohort.

We‚Äôre grateful for your contributions and can‚Äôt wait to see what you preserve and share.

# **Appendix**

## **Practice the 3-2-1-1-0 Backup Strategy**

While decentralized tools like IPFS and Filecoin offer powerful new preservation options, it's important to remember that these are still **emerging technologies**. As such, we do not recommend relying on them as your only backup method.

Instead, consider IPFS to be one part of a broader **digital resilience strategy**, especially for preserving public, fixed-content materials. A modern, more comprehensive framework is the **3-2-1-1-0 backup strategy**, which builds on traditional models to address modern threats like ransomware.

We recommend that all Cultural Memory Lab participants adopt the [3-2-1-1-0 model](https://www.impossiblecloud.com/blog/the-golden-rules-of-backup-strategy-from-3-2-1-to-3-2-1-1-0), which incorporates the following principles:

* **3 \= Maintain Three Copies of Your Data**  
   Keep one primary version and two additional backups to avoid a single point of failure.

* **2 \= Use Two Separate Storage Media**  
   Store your backups on two different types of storage (e.g., cloud platform \+ external drive, or local server \+ IPFS). This provides protection from hardware or service-specific issues.

* **1 \= Keep One Copy Offsite**  
   At least one backup should be stored in a geographically separate location to guard against local disasters (fire, flood, theft, etc.). Decentralized storage can play this role.

* **1 \= Store One Copy Offline or Immutably**  
   To defend against ransomware or malicious deletion, one backup should be disconnected from the internet (air-gapped) or made immutable ‚Äî meaning it cannot be altered or deleted. IPFS's content-addressed storage with cryptographic verification can support immutability.

* **0 \= Ensure Zero Backup Errors**  
   Monitor and test your backups regularly. Run restore checks and make sure backups complete without errors so that you're ready if you ever need to recover.

![][image11]

This expanded approach prepares you not just for data loss, but for emerging cyber threats and long-term accessibility. By implementing 3-2-1-1-0, you ensure that your digital collections remain protected, retrievable, and trustworthy.

## **What Types of Files Are Appropriate for IPFS?**

While IPFS is ideal for many kinds of digital preservation, it's not suitable for everything. Below is a helpful guide to understand what works well ‚Äî and what raises concerns:

| Feature | Benefits | Concerns |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Immutability** | **Files cannot be altered once uploaded, supporting historical accuracy.** | **Mistakes or sensitive data cannot be removed ‚Äî important for personal or copyrighted files.** |
| **Verifiability** | Files have a cryptographic hash (CID), so integrity can be independently verified. | Users must understand CIDs; verifying doesn't imply content validity or legal clarity. |
| **Data Sovereignty** | You can choose where and how to host content, outside of centralized control. | Requires technical confidence; some users may not understand where their data is hosted. |
| **Vendor Lock-in Avoidance** | Content can be accessed through any IPFS gateway or node. | Long-term access still depends on someone pinning the content or using Filecoin to guarantee availability. |

### **‚úÖ Recommended File Types**

* Public reports, PDFs, zines  
* Educational resources or toolkits  
* Oral histories (with permission)  
* Archival scans, photos, public datasets

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Use Caution With**

* Personal data (health, identity, contact info)  
* Content subject to copyright  
* Files that may need updates or takedowns

**Tip:** If in doubt, ask: "Would I feel comfortable making this content permanent and globally accessible?"

If not, consider local or encrypted alternatives instead of IPFS.

## **Addressing Authenticity and Provenance with the Starling Framework**

Some digital content‚Äîespecially evidence, testimonies, or archival material‚Äîmay face questions about its **authenticity or provenance**. In these cases, decentralized storage alone may not be enough.

To strengthen trust, consider incorporating [The Starling Framework](https://www.starlinglab.org/journalism-framework/) ‚Äî a methodology developed by the [Starling Lab](https://www.starlinglab.org) for capturing, storing, and verifying sensitive digital content:

### **The Starling Framework: Capture, Store & Verify**

* **CAPTURE** Use authenticated capture tools to embed secure metadata (such as timestamps and location data) at the point of creation.

* **STORE** Preserve content using cryptographic protocols and decentralized networks to ensure long-term integrity and replication.

* **VERIFY** Register assets on an immutable ledger (like a blockchain) to allow for third-party verification of authenticity and provenance.

This approach is especially useful when working with **journalistic materials**, **human rights documentation**, or **fragile historical records**.

## **Create an `index.html` Homepage for Your Archive** {#create-an-index.html-homepage-for-your-archive}

*This is an optional step, but recommended for projects teams with HTML skills.*

When you upload a folder to IPFS, it is accessible through a public IPFS gateway. By default, visitors will see a basic file browser ‚Äî a simple directory listing that works, but may not offer the best experience for viewers who are unfamiliar with IPFS or digital archives.

**But there‚Äôs a better way.**  
 If your archive folder contains a file named `index.html` at the root level, IPFS gateways will automatically load and display it when someone visits your CID link. This allows you to design a custom homepage for your archive ‚Äî improving usability, context, and presentation.

This optional technique is what powers more advanced "Data Lifeboat"-style archives, such as the [Flickr Commons Lifeboat.](https://bafybeid7qd7sadzt3c452penwyypo6tmwtlxpqhqox3gycscvkxszk6a2a.ipfs.w3s.link/) 

### **Benefits of Using `index.html`:**

* Presents your archive with curated structure and visuals  
* Enables navigation, context, and storytelling through HTML  
* Offers an accessible, public interface ‚Äî no IPFS knowledge required

### **How to Serve an `index.html` File:**

1. **Prepare Your Files:**  
    Collect your archive materials and organize them in a folder. This is the folder you will upload to IPFS. ![][image12]

2. **Create an `index.html` File:**  
    Add a file named `index.html` to the root of your folder. This will serve as the homepage when someone visits your archive via an IPFS gateway. You can:  
* Use a simple HTML list of files  
* Build on your existing `README.md` for structure and archive descriptions

**Tips:**

* Always use **relative links** in your HTML (e.g., `images/photo.jpg`, `./file.pdf`)  
* You may use a static site generator to help create the HTML

3. **Upload the File to IPFS:**  
    Upload your folder (including your `index.html` file) to IPFS. After uploading, you‚Äôll receive a unique CID.

4. **Access the File via the Gateway:**  
    Use a public gateway like https://\<CID\>.ipfs.w3s.link/index.html to view your site.

5. Creating an `index.html` gives your archive a professional, approachable web presence. It‚Äôs a great option for those comfortable with basic HTML and looking to offer an inviting gateway into their collection.
