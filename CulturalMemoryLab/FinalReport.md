# Preserving Memory on the Decentralized Web: Stories from the Cultural Memory Lab

### **Overview**

The *Cultural Memory Lab*, led by TechSoup in collaboration with **Gray Area** and supported by the **Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW)**, set out to help cultural heritage institutions explore how decentralized storage could safeguard public collections. The Lab convened archivists, artists, and technologists from around the world to translate emerging decentralized web (DWeb) technologies into practical, community-centered preservation tools.

Over eight months, participants developed working prototypes using **IPFS** and **Filecoin**, supported by microgrants, mentorship, and a tightly structured cohort model. The Lab combined technical learning with community storytelling, fostering a shared belief that preserving memory requires both digital resilience and human connection.

### **Program Partners**

The Cultural Memory Lab was made possible through the collaboration of:

* **Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW)** â€” for their generous funding and technical partnership.

* **Gray Area** â€” for leading technical training and producing the closing documentary.

* **DWeb and Archival Experts**  â€” Organizations like **Shift Collective**, **Starling Lab**, **221A**, **Museum of Native American History**, and **The Black History Foundation** provided input, mentorship, and DWeb expertise during the program design.

Together, these partners demonstrated that decentralized storage can be implemented ethically and accessibly to protect community histories worldwide.

### **Cohort Participants**

The Cultural Memory Lab cohort represented a powerful cross-section of cultural stewards and creative technologists:

* **{B/qKC}: A Black Queer Archive** â€” Developed by *Nasir Montalvo*, this archive preserves the creative and cultural history of Black queer communities, hosted via IPFS to ensure permanence beyond institutional walls.

* **Digital Memory Keepers: Decentralized Archiving of Zapotec Biocultural Knowledge** â€” Led by *Kiado Cruz*, this project built a model for Indigenous-led digital sovereignty, embedding cultural protocols into decentralized workflows.

* **Mobility Independence Foundation Web Portal Project** â€” The team created an open-source repository for accessibility and assistive technology history, demonstrating how decentralized systems can support disability justice.  

* **Archiving Myanmarâ€™s Digital Landscape** â€” Protecting the online record of Myanmarâ€™s democratic movements and digital culture amid censorship and loss.
  

Each project combined archival care with community voiceâ€”transforming decentralized technology from a theoretical construct into a lived tool for equity.

### **Cohort Outcomes**

Each Lab participant completed a functional decentralized archive â€” achieving a *100% completion rate* across all projects. Participants reported moving from conceptual understanding to practical implementation, gaining confidence in decentralized tools while centering community sovereignty over data .

Key outcomes included:

* **Hands-on IPFS implementation** for cultural memory collections.

* **Improved digital sovereignty practices**, particularly archives at risk of political repression.

* **Open-source documentation** and templates released on [GitHub](https://github.com/CaravanStudios/PublicGoodAppHouse/tree/main/CulturalMemoryLab) for replication by others in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector.

* **A public video showcase**, demonstrating working archives hosted on decentralized networks.

### **Lessons Learned**

**1\. Implementation requires culture, not just content.**

Cohorts succeed when participants receive sustained guidance and real-world feedback, not only educational materials.

**2\. Peer learning and expert mentorship multiply results.**

The most progress occurred in spaces where Filecoin engineers, Gray Area mentors, and community peers problem-solved together in real time.

**3\. Systems outperform single events.**

A structured, time-boxed model with shared templates and follow-up support led to measurable adoption â€” unlike one-off workshops, which raised awareness but didnâ€™t yield implementation.

**4\. Accessibility drives inclusion.**

Pre-recorded presentations with captions, multilingual support, and low-bandwidth publishing options improved participation across geographies.

### **Paths Forward**

The Cultural Memory Labâ€™s success has informed the development of a scalable model for helping civil society adopt decentralized infrastructure. Future iterations could focus on:

* Launching a **Trusted Consultant Network** to connect GLAM institutions with vetted DWeb experts.

* Expanding **Guide-Led Cohorts**â€”small, peer-supported learning groups where recent implementers mentor newcomers.

* Building an **open Template Library** of reproducible workflows for decentralized storage like IPFS, metadata standards, and accessibility.

* Sustaining an **ecosystem of Guides, Experts, and Facilitators** to maintain the culture of shared learning the Lab began.

### **Acknowledgments**

This work would not have been possible without the support of:

**Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web**, **Gray Area**, and the many DWeb mentors and community participants who contributed their time and expertise.

Their shared commitment to accessible, community-owned infrastructure continues to inspire the next wave of GLAM innovators building for permanence, equity, and digital sovereignty.
