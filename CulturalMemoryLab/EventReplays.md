# üåç Cultural Memory Lab ‚Äì Local Node Event Archive

Welcome to the **Cultural Memory Lab** archive! This repository collects replays, slide decks, and event descriptions from our Local Node events across the globe. These gatherings are part of our mission to support decentralized, ethical, and community-centered approaches to digital preservation, especially for underrepresented histories and GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) institutions.

Use this archive to revisit insights, share learnings, and inspire future digital memory work.
