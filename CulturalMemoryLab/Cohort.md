# Introducing the Cultural Memory Lab Cohort: Empowering Community Archives Through Decentralized Technology

TechSoup is thrilled to announce the launch of the [Cultural Memory Lab](https://grayarea.org/initiative/cultural-memory-lab/), a collaboration between **Gray Area**, **Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW),** and **TechSoup**. This program represents an important step forward in our mission to bridge emerging technologies with the needs of civil society organizations, specifically, organizations building more secure community archives that preserve underrepresented histories.

## A Global Response to Digital Preservation Challenges

From an impressive pool of 181 applications worldwide, we've selected three pioneering projects that demonstrate exceptional approaches to cultural memory preservation. Each project exemplifies our core values of community ownership, technological innovation, and sustainable preservation of diverse histories.

## Meet Our Inaugural Cohort

### {B/qKC}: A Black Queer Archive

{B/qKC} challenges outdated archival practices through accessible storytelling and intergenerational power building. This project documents the rich and often overlooked history of Kansas City’s Black queer community, including the underground ballroom tradition and the forced closure of Soakie’s — the city’s only Black gay bar. Through a unique licensing model, contributors retain ownership of their materials while benefiting from digitization and storytelling efforts. {B/qKC} aims to use decentralized storage to ensure long-term accessibility of its growing digital archive and explore DAO models for community governance.

### Digital Memory Keepers: Decentralized Archiving of Zapotec Biocultural Knowledge

Servicios Universitarios y Redes de Conocimientos en Oaxaca’s project collaborates with Zapotec communities in Oaxaca to document and preserve traditional agricultural practices, environmental vocabulary, and oral histories. With a focus on indigenous data sovereignty, the project will deploy decentralized storage solutions to safeguard biocultural knowledge while maintaining community control over digital heritage. By integrating decentralized technologies, Digital Memory Keepers will create a bilingual archival system accessible to Zapotec speakers and the broader public.

### The Mobility Independence Foundation’s Open-Source Online Repository

The Mobility Independence Foundation’s project will create a long-term, decentralized archive of open-source designs for durable medical equipment (DME). By ensuring unrestricted access to the technical blueprints of essential mobility technology, this project empowers individuals with disabilities, engineers, and repair technicians worldwide with the right of self-repair. Through decentralized storage, the repository will safeguard DME designs, empower users with the knowledge and resources to maintain their own equipment, and reduce dependency on expensive, slow-moving manufacturers and insurers.

## Supporting Innovative Approaches to Cultural Memory

## The [Cultural Memory Lab](https://grayarea.org/initiative/cultural-memory-lab/) is a four-month incubator designed to help community-based archives integrate decentralized technologies into their work. 

## Each selected project receives the following:

* $3,500 – $5,000 in direct project funding  
* Access to Gray Area’s eight-week [DWeb for Creators course](https://grayarea.org/course/dweb/)  
* Dedicated technical mentorship from experts at Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web (FFDW)  
* Regular cohort check-ins for collaborative learning and peer support  
* Coaching on project planning and budgeting to improve future grant applications  
* Showcase events to feature project outcomes to DWeb leaders and potential funders

What distinguishes this program is our commitment to providing a blend of individualized technical support and collaborative learning opportunities. By providing technical resources and mentorship, we are helping these projects build sustainable, decentralized archival models that protect cultural heritage and empower their communities.

## Acknowledging Our Partners and Judges

Our selection process was guided by an evaluation of the short-listed candidates, led by Mai Ishikawa Sutton, Associate Producer of Decentralized Web Projects at Internet Archive, and Kaitlin Donovan, Senior Program Manager at Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. Their evaluations focused on community representation and impact; innovative use of decentralized technologies; implementation feasibility, expertise and experience of project teams; and alignment with program goals.

## A Heartfelt Thanks to All Applicants

With 181 applications from around the world, the response to the Cultural Memory Lab exceeded our expectations. We are inspired by the incredible work being done by so many dedicated archivists, technologists, and community organizers to preserve cultural memory in innovative ways. While we could only select three projects for this cohort, we are committed to continuing to support and grow this network of practitioners.
