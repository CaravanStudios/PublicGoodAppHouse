# Guidelines for Expectations and Conduct in Maker Studio Sessions 

_(Inspired by Open Space Technology)_

_Last Updated November 2023_

**1. Whoever Comes Are the Right People:** We embrace the contributions of all participants, valuing diverse perspectives and skills. We all come as equals in the pursuit of innovation, and years of experience, education, or affiliation are valuable but do not necessarily take priority over any other insight or perspective.

**2. Whatever Happens Is the Only Thing That Could Have:** We encourage creativity and innovation, acknowledging that outcomes may be unexpected, differ from the original intention, but valuable nonetheless.

**3. Whenever It Starts Is the Right Time:** Flexibility in collaboration and discussion is key to how we collaborate. We acknowledged that ideas can emerge at any moment.

**4. When It's Over, It's Over:** We focus on the quality of engagement rather than the quantity of time spent. We believe discussions should be purposeful and not dragged out if inspiration and possibilities have been exhausted.

**5. Respect and Inclusion:** We foster an environment of mutual respect and active listening. We are inclusive and considerate in all interactions.

**6. Chatham House Rules for Confidentiality and Open Communication:** To encourage openness and the sharing of information, anyone who participates agrees to uphold Chatham House Rules. 

__What does this mean?__

Participants are free to use the information received during our sessions, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speakers, nor that of any other participant, may be revealed. This approach ensures that everyone can express their views and insights freely without concern of external judgment or unwanted disclosure. It's vital that all participants commit to these rules to maintain a safe, trusting environment for genuine dialogue and innovation.

**Implementation Note:**

These guidelines will be presented clearly at the beginning of each session and included in any pre-session materials. This ensures that every participant understands the expectations and feels comfortable engaging in open, meaningful discussions while respecting the confidentiality and integrity of the ideas and discussions that take place in Maker Studio Sessions.
