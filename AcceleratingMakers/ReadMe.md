# Accelerating Makers

> **Goal:** “Helping technology builders and nonprofits co-create tools that are purpose-built for public good.”

We believe that nonprofits and civil society organizations struggle because they don’t have easy access to trusted professionals who can support them in the discovery and implementation of  new technology solutions, but they also don’t have access to purpose-built tools that map to their values and goals. For too long, civil society professionals have been forced to hack together traditional for-profit enterprise solutions to fit their needs.

The Accelerating Makers program brings together the makers and builders of purpose-built tech solutions with the nonprofits and civil society organizations who are ready, willing and able to integrate new tools and approaches to better serve their mission. Through dialogue, shared learning, and co-creation of new technology solutions we can bring purpose-built solutions to the people and organizations who are solving humanity’s most pressing issues.

Accelerating Makers is a community experience that combines online events, educational materials, and facilitated connections to help technology builders and nonprofit users grow their understanding, challenge themselves and take action.

At launch, the first series of content and conversations is dedicated to the Decentralized Web, also known as DWeb. This technology promises a future that doesn’t rely on central ownership and control, it offers independence and empowers change makers to build and use responsible tech for public good.

Regardless of what makers are building, if it’s intended to support public good and civil society on a journey to improving our world, this community is here to support how it can incorporate DWeb and other new technologies.

# The Mission

Accelerating Makers’ mission orbits around facilitating a more direct and intimate connection between civil society leaders and the makers of purpose-built tools. To cultivate a fertile ground where learning and innovation go hand in hand, nurturing the development and integration of new public good technology solutions with one goal in mind – to extend the reach and impact of change-agents working on the most pressing issues of our time.

# What’s in it for Makers?

Makers have the opportunity to:

* **Connect directly with nonprofits** to bring them into the development process
* **Accelerate development** of purpose-built tools with resources, support, and experienced mentors
* **Learn storytelling skills **that will help get the solution funded, launched, and used
* **Launch tech solutions** within a community of early adopters & innovators

# What’s in it for Nonprofits?

Nonprofits & Civil Society Organizations have the opportunity to:

* **Upgrade their tech stack** to be more resilient and adaptable
* **Learn technology applications** and bring experience back to your organization 
* **Co-create purposeful tools** instead of making due with the 'standard'
* **Become self-sufficient **and take control of the tech you use

# Community Programming

Accelerating Makers programming is founded on three main pillars: Events, Resources, and Connections. It’s through these that we’ll offer a wide range of ways to interact and develop community learning around the Decentralized Web.

**Weekly Online Events**

Explore new topics and challenge your thinking around decentralized web applications in a live atmosphere where everyone is open to learning at all stages. These will be recorded and available for the community to consume on-demand as well.

**Digital Resources**

Digital resources will be hosted within Accelerating Makers and available any time. These will cover various formats, such as technology explainers, guides, frameworks, how-tos, case studies, use cases, and storytelling templates. These and other learning materials will be made available for all event attendees at no charge. 

**New Connections**

The power of knowledge from the community is greater than organizers could ever provide, and because of this, we facilitate introductions between community members, give them a forum to connect live during events, and have open discussions in our dedicated Slack group. Peer support, user feedback, and informal mentorship will help members navigate mental models, decision making
