# Leveraging Cryptocurrencies For Civil Society
>A Guide For Civil Society Leaders To Learn The Basics Of Cryptocurrencies And How To Use Them For Social Impact

# What Are Cryptocurrencies?
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that are built with blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies aren‚Äôt geographically linked to any one location or country and operate in a decentralized way without a singular authority. This makes them uniquely positioned for civil society organizations by helping to reduce transaction fees and processing time, to facilitate international fund transfers, and to increase inclusion for those outside of traditional banking systems. Bitcoin, ethereum, and over 20,000 other cryptocurrencies enable these peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. 

# How Cryptocurrencies Work
Cryptocurrencies work through a decentralized network of computers that maintain a shared digital ledger called a blockchain. This blockchain records all transactions in a secure and transparent manner. Users store their cryptocurrency holdings in digital wallets, each associated with a pair of cryptographic keys: a public address for receiving funds and a private key for authorizing transactions. When a user initiates a cryptocurrency transaction, it is broadcast to the network, validated, and added to the blockchain, where they are secure, transparent, and immutable.

# Benefits
## Reduced Transaction Costs
Cryptocurrencies streamline financial transactions by eliminating intermediaries such as banks. This significantly reduces conversion and transaction fees, making it cost-effective, especially for international payments. 

## Faster Transactions
Without intermediaries, cryptocurrencies allow fast transfers of funds, particularly across countries where banks are usually required. When applied across many countries simultaneously, this can drastically increase the ability of an organization to consolidate funds and deploy resources.

## Enhanced Financial Inclusion
Cryptocurrencies provide access to financial services for individuals and communities with limited access to traditional banking. This fosters financial inclusion, enabling organizations to reach underserved populations, expand their donor base, and support a more extensive range of beneficiaries.

## Increased Transparency and Accountability
Blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrencies, provides a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. Organizations can use this to showcase the allocation and utilization of funds, ensuring transparency and building trust with donors and stakeholders.

# How CSOs Can Use Cryptocurrencies
CSOs can leverage cryptocurrencies in several ways to advance their missions and operations.

## Fundraising and Donations 
CSOs can accept cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum as donations, broadening their donor base among tech-savvy individuals and global audiences. This simplifies cross-border transactions and reduces transaction fees. For ease of implementation, look for a cryptocurrency donation platform, such as The Giving Block, to facilitate it for you.

## Extended Beneficiary Reach
Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to marginalized communities with limited access to traditional banking. By transferring funds using cryptocurrencies, CSOs can financially support individuals and organizations that were previously impossible to reach, such as developing nations or those experiencing political unrest .

## Cost-Efficient Aid
In international humanitarian efforts, CSOs can use cryptocurrencies for swift and cost-effective fund transfers. This is especially relevant in emergency situations where funds need to be distributed quickly.

## Investment and Asset Management
CSOs can include cryptocurrencies as a part of their investment or endowment portfolios. Surplus funds can potentially gain from price appreciation similarly to how stocks or bonds would. However, the value of cryptocurrencies is extremely volatile, making this a high-risk investment option.

# Real-World Applications
## Pathways to Education
[Pathways to Education](https://www.pathwaystoeducation.ca/donate-bitcoin/), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting underserved students, has accepted cryptocurrency donations since 2013. This innovative move expands its donor base, facilitating global contributions and fostering financial inclusion. It also enables it to bring in a new donor base that may not have otherwise donated to the organization.

## Save the Children
[Save the Children](https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/2022-press-releases/save-the-children-raises-crypto-to-support-ukraine) used cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, for its Ukraine emergency appeal. This innovative approach expanded its donor base, enabling borderless giving and decentralized philanthropy. Crypto donations have become a significant funding source for global crises, supporting essential humanitarian aid, education, and psychosocial assistance for affected children and families.

## The Giving Block
[The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com/), a cryptocurrency donation platform, connects charities with the world of digital assets. It enables nonprofit organizations to accept various cryptocurrencies, expanding their fundraising avenues, without ever having to touch crypto. They simply receive local currency in their bank accounts. This approach empowers charities to tap into the growing crypto community, fostering financial support and engagement for their causes.
