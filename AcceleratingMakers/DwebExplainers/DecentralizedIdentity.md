# What Is a Decentralized Identity?
A decentralized identity system, also referred to as a self-sovereign identity, is a concept in the field of identity management and authentication that seeks to give individuals greater control and ownership over their identity and the personal information that goes with it. Traditional identity systems, such as passports or login credentials, typically rely on centralized authorities to validate and manage user identities. Decentralized identity aims to shift this control back to the individuals themselves by storing that identity on a blockchain and removing the need for centralized control.

# How Do Blockchains Enable Decentralized Identities?
In a decentralized identity system, individuals are assigned unique identifiers called _decentralized identifiers_ (DIDs), which are owned and managed by the individuals themselves. These DIDs are typically stored on a blockchain or another decentralized network to ensure security and immutability. Associated with each DID is a DID document, containing relevant information such as public keys and authentication methods. When individuals need to authenticate or share specific attributes, they use cryptographic keys associated with their DIDs to prove ownership and control over their identity. This user-centric approach allows for selective disclosure of information, granting individuals greater control over their personal data and reducing reliance on centralized entities for identity verification.

# Benefits
## Individual Control over Data
In a decentralized identity system, users are the owners of their identities, which provides greater control over their personal information and who can access it. They can choose which aspects of their identity to share and with whom, without relying on intermediaries. For example, in contrast to sharing your driverâ€™s license to prove your age, which also reveals your address and complete birthdate, with a decentralized ID, you could show your birth year without revealing any additional information.

## Reduced Identity Fraud
The combination of cryptographic security and user control can significantly reduce the risk of identity fraud. Decentralized identity systems often leverage techniques like zero-knowledge proofs. These allow one party to prove to another that they know a specific piece of information without revealing the actual information.

## Verifiability
Decentralized identity systems make it easy to verify if information or credentials are legitimate by leveraging cryptographic techniques to prove the authenticity of an identity claim. This can enhance trust, speed up processes, and reduce the reliance on third-party verification to prove a credential is genuine.

## Portability and Interoperability
Decentralized identities enable users to carry their identity with them across different services and platforms. This portability is designed to make it easier for individuals to use their identity in various contexts and can reduce the need to create and manage separate accounts and credentials for different online services.

## Protection from Confiscation
A decentralized identity is owned and managed by the individual and stored on immutable legers in a decentralized network. Regardless of the type of information stored in the identity, this ensures that no corporation or government could access, tamper with, or confiscate the identity without the cooperation of the individual.

## Resistance to Data Breaches
Since decentralized identities distribute data across a network, there is no central repository of sensitive information vulnerable to large-scale data breaches. This decentralization can make it more challenging for malicious actors to compromise a large number of identities in a single attack.

# How CSOs Can Use Decentralized Identities
## Identities for Refugees or Displaced People
Many refugees and displaced people lack identity documentation, which prevents them from accessing critical services like healthcare, income support, and education. This is why many CSOs provide them with new identification and digital documentation. However, using centralized databases for this critical information could be replaced by a more secure, self-managed, decentralized identity system.

## Financial Inclusion
Decentralized identities can help individuals who lack traditional forms of identification gain access to financial services. By using blockchain-based identities, people can establish their trustworthiness and creditworthiness, enabling them to open trading accounts, access loans, and participate in the formal financial system. This can help reduce poverty and empower underserved communities.

## Education Credentials
Decentralized identity systems can be used to issue, verify, and share educational credentials securely. This helps reduce fraud in the education sector and ensures that an individualâ€™s qualifications are recognized and transferable across institutions and countries. This is relevant for lifelong learning and online education and could be useful for CSOs that provide training courses or other certifications.

## Voting and Elections
Blockchain-based decentralized identities can be used to verify the identity of voters securely, reducing the risk of voter fraud and enhancing the integrity of elections. This has the potential to increase voter turnout and confidence in the electoral process, contributing to better governance, particularly in decentralized organizations like DAOs.

## Secure and Private Membership Management
CSOs often have members and stakeholders whose identities need to be managed securely. Decentralized identities can streamline membership processes, allowing individuals to maintain control over their personal information while the organization ensures the integrity of its membership database. This can be beneficial for organizations working in regions where privacy concerns or security risks are prevalent.

# Real-World Applications
## Proof of Humanity
[Proof of Humanity](https://proofofhumanity.id/) is a DAO that enables people to create decentralized self-sovereign identities on the Ethereum blockchain. Its goal is to enable people to use this identity to easily receive payments as a part of a universal basic income scheme. The identities are also being used to reduce the risk of sybil attacks when they are connected to decentralized applications.

## Diwala
[Diwala](https://www.diwala.io/) has created a platform that enables schools and NGOs to issue skill-based identities backed by blockchain technology. A skill-ID is a digitally verified record of a personâ€™s educational and work history. Diwala is building an ecosystem of trust by enabling educational institutions and organizations to safely and digitally issue and verify credentials. This will, in turn, save all parties time and money and build a bridge for global work opportunities for untapped talent. By utilizing a decentralized identity management tool, Diwalaâ€™s application will also give people ownership of their data information.

## COVID-19 Credentials Initiative
The [COVID-19 Credentials Initiative](https://www.covidcreds.org/) (CCI), a project of the Sovrin Foundation, is a global, cross-sector community of organizations using digital identity as a way to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and reboot public trust. The goal was to fast-track an immunity passport solution to help curb the coronavirus pandemic. The initiativeâ€™s supporters deployed verifiable credential solutions based on the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0, which the Sovrin community helped establish.
