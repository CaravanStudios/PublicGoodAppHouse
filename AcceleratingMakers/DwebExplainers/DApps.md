# Understanding How DApps Can Create Social Impact
>A Guide To Decentralized Apps (DApps) For Civil Society Leaders

# What Is A DApp?
A DApp, short for "decentralized application," is a type of software application that runs on a decentralized network of computers, typically using blockchain technology. These DApps may look and operate just like the apps we use today, but unlike traditional, centralized apps, DApps operate on a peer-to-peer network, giving them several distinct advantages.

In addition to operating on decentralized networks, DApps are marked by several key characteristics that set them apart: 

* Commonly open-source 
* Often employ smart contracts for automation
* Rely on consensus mechanisms for agreement
* Use native tokens or existing cryptocurrencies for transactions
* Prioritize user control over data and assets 

These features collectively redefine traditional application paradigms, fostering transparency, efficiency, and user empowerment.

# Benefits
## Trust and Transparency 
DApps typically operate on blockchain technology, which offers both transparency and immutability. This can help build trust in applications and systems, especially in areas like finance, supply chain management, and voting systems.

## Reduced Costs
With peer-to-peer interactions, DApps eliminate middlemen and intermediaries. This can reduce costs and streamline processes in various industries, benefiting organizations and DApp users.

## Censorship Resistance

DApps are often resistant to censorship because they canâ€™t be controlled or shut down by governments or other centralized bodies as easily as a traditional app. This is particularly important in regions where freedom of expression is limited: It allows access and sharing of information without fear of government intervention.

## Ownership of Data
DApps can give users more control over their data. Unlike a traditional app, where the creator of the app owns, controls, and often sells user data for profit, in a DApp, the user owns their data and can decide what data to share. In some cases, a user may even be compensated for sharing their data.

# How CSOs Can Use Decentralized Applications
The functions of decentralized applications are as broad as the functions of traditional applications today. Here are a few examples of areas where civil society organizations can use DApps to advance their missions and operations.

## Secure Voting and Governance
DApps can be used to conduct secure and tamper-resistant internal elections, enabling members to vote on key issues or select leaders. This ensures the democratic functioning of the organization across its membership.

## Supply Chain Management
If a CSO is involved in distributing goods or resources, DApps can provide transparency in the supply chain, ensuring that aid reaches its intended recipients and is not diverted or misused. It can also ensure that products came from verified sources or were produced in a sustainable or organic manner. 

## Cross-Border Collaboration
DApps can enable CSOs to collaborate across borders, making it easier to work on global issues, share resources and finances, and coordinate efforts. This is because blockchain-based DApps donâ€™t have the same geographic restrictions that centralized apps can have, particularly when it comes to finance.

## Decentralized Fundraising
CSOs can explore decentralized funding mechanisms using DApps that allow them to raise funds without relying on traditional banks or financial intermediaries. This use of cryptocurrencies could expand their potential donor pool by enabling them to raise funds quickly and from across borders.

# Real-World Applications
## Votemâ€™s Proof of Vote

[Votem](https://votem.com/) is a blockchain-based mobile voting platform that enables citizens around the world to easily vote online with a level of verifiability, accessibility, security, and transparency that does not currently exist. Votemâ€™s mission is to change the way people vote, and it believes that mobile voting will lead to positive change in the world by providing voters with complete transparency, thus shaping the future of democracy. The platform can be used by CSOs to conduct secure and transparent elections or decision-making processes, enhancing the democratic functioning of the organization. 

## FarmaTrust
[FarmaTrust](https://www.farmatrust.com/) employs blockchain to enhance transparency in pharmaceutical supply chains. Its mission is to protect patients, eliminate counterfeit products, and increase efficiency throughout the entire pharma supply chain. CSOs involved in healthcare and medicine can use this DApp to ensure the authenticity and safety of medical supplies.

## Giveth
[Giveth](https://giveth.io/) is a DApp built on the ethereum blockchain that focuses on transparent and decentralized charitable giving. It is building a new way to fundraise with a zero-fee, community-driven donation platform, leveraging the power of blockchain technology to connect on-the-ground projects with regenerative funding opportunities. Giveth allows donors to track their donations, see where the funds are going, and participate in governance decisions related to the platform.
