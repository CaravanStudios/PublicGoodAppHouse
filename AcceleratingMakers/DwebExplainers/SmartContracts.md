# Smart Contracts
> In this explainer, we will outline what smart contracts are and the potential benefits they present to civil society. Weâ€™ll also show you real-world examples of their use and explain why they might help you and your organization.

## What Are Smart Contracts?
Smart contracts are automated, secure, digital agreements that run on blockchain. Essentially, smart contracts trigger a set of outcomes when an outside source â€” an "oracle" â€” hits a certain parameter. Think of them as if-then statements written in code (e.g., "if _x_ happens, then execute the action _y_"). By using a smart contract, you can eliminate any centralized intermediaries that previously were required to execute that action.

Smart contracts boost accountability and trust among stakeholders by offering automated and transparent transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering costs. These transactions can be financial (e.g., releasing a payment). However, smart contracts can also be used to automate nonfinancial actions like voting, managing memberships, or giving access to a resource like an image or a song.

## Benefits
Smart contracts bring several benefits to organizations.

### Cost Efficiency
Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing associated fees and administrative costs. This efficiency results in lower operational expenses for tasks like verification, enforcement, and recordkeeping.

### Speed
Automation within smart contracts accelerates processes by removing manual steps. Transactions and agreements are executed swiftly and without delays caused by middlemen, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

### Anti-Corruption
Smart contracts operate on tamper-proof blockchain technology. This transparency and immutability decrease the potential for fraudulent activities or corruption, ensuring that agreements are executed precisely as programmed and preventing unauthorized alterations. The absence of intermediaries also reduces the risk of biased or unethical practices.

## How You Can Use Smart Contracts
Individuals within civil society organizations can harness smart contracts for various practical applications, enhancing efficiency and accountability.

### Automated Fund Release
Smart contracts enable conditional fund release, ensuring that resources are used as intended. For instance, if a CSO receives donations for a specific project, the funds can be programmed to automatically release only when certain milestones are met. Donors can track progress in real time, and funds are disbursed efficiently without manual intervention. This system prevents misuse of funds because deviations from the predetermined conditions would be flagged and addressed.

### Voting Outcomes
Smart contracts can revolutionize CSO decision-making processes by enabling secure and transparent voting that automatically triggers outcomes. Members can cast votes directly on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records and preventing fraud. The outcomes are automatically tallied, providing real-time results and reducing the need for manual counting. This enhances inclusivity because it further enables remote digital voting and promotes trust among members, who can independently verify the integrity of the voting process. When the result of the vote is determined, the contract will automatically execute the task voted on, for example, transferring funds to a particular project.

### Transparency
CSOs often strive for transparency to gain stakeholders' trust. Smart contracts can facilitate this by recording all decisions, transactions, and communications on the blockchain. This creates an auditable and permanent record accessible to all authorized parties. Because smart contracts eliminate the need for centralized intermediaries, there is less risk of corruption. As a result, CSOs can demonstrate their commitment to openness, which is crucial for maintaining donor confidence and promoting collaboration.

## Real-World Applications

### St. Mungo's
Homelessness charity St. Mungo's employed results-based financing to incentivize impactful charity projects by paying only upon goal achievement. It enhances transparency by publicly sharing project performance and aiding donors in selecting effective initiatives. Through blockchain smart contracts, [donations are locked until verified goals are met](https://www.mungos.org/press_release/st-mungos-partners-blockchain-fundraisers-help-rough-sleepers/), thereby ensuring accountability. For instance, to house individuals temporarily, Â£200 per person is raised and only released upon independent validation.

### Etherisc 
Etherisc is an innovative [insurance system built on ethereum and indexed to local weather parameters](https://www.cryptoaltruism.org/blog/etherisc-using-blockchain-technology-to-deliver-crop-insurance). Etherisc makes use of Chainlinkâ€™s oracle network, which provides a reliable connection to external weather data sources. In the event of an extreme weather event, smart contracts in insurance policies are triggered automatically and pay out the insurance benefit to the policyholder.

### Amply Project
The Amply project, leveraging blockchain, has pioneered results-based financing in education. By addressing South Africa's challenge of children lacking proper identification for government subsidies, Amply's mobile app lets schools [digitally record attendance, enabling eligibility for subsidies](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/ixo-foundation-blockchain-based-response-un-call-data-revolution). Blockchain and smart contracts underpin the app, allowing third-party verification of attendance claims. To date, the pilot has logged over 80,000 attendances and benefited 3,327 children across 87 centers. This innovation saves teachers 4,000 hours monthly and establishes an immutable attendance record, facilitating automated government payments.

### Brooklyn Microgrid
The Brooklyn Microgrid project allows neighbors to [sell any excess renewable energy](https://www.brooklyn.energy/) they produce from small-scale solar systems. Software used by producers uses smart contracts to automatically sell power to buyers at particular prices based on parameters set by the producers. If power is unavailable from one source, buyers can easily switch to another source automatically that will sell them power within their predetermined price range.

## Using Smart Contracts Responsibly
Smart contracts can significantly improve the efficiency of your operations, but only if the code is perfect. Errors in smart contract code can have catastrophic results, so it is critical to have your code be open-source for review by the public, but also reviewed by smart contract auditors.
