# What is the Decentralized Web?
## A Guide for Civil Society
> The decentralized web (DWeb, also known as Web 3.0 or Web3) is the product of a technological movement that aims to distribute the internet (including data and applications) across a network of connected devices as opposed to large, centrally controlled entities.

The current, centralized version of the web allows a few big companies to control its infrastructure and provide the
rules that govern our interactions and experiences. They also profit from our aggregate data, from which we are barred access. Using blockchain-enabled DWeb technology like decentralized currency (e.g., Bitcoin), decentralized storage (e.g., Filecoin) and decentralized governance (e.g., DreamDAO) the DWeb aims to give power back to the end users.

## What is a blockchain?
Blockchain technology is key to understanding the DWeb. A blockchain is a record of transactions maintained by a distributed network of users rather than a central organization. Transactions happen peer-to-peer, without intermediaries, and it is almost impossible for any individual or group to alter the record once it has been made.
This makes blockchain a foundation of the DWeb. It also offers benefits that align with the aims of civil society organizations, including the potential for greater transparency, privacy, and security.

## How are civil society organizations already using the DWeb?
### Organization: `United Nations`
Use case: `Identity`

This puts users in control of their personal data, making it safer for beneficiaries to register and withdraw funds.
[The United Nations Refugee Agency](https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/protect-human-rights/protection/registration-and-identity-management) (UNHCR) is using DID technology to create a digital identity system for refugees. This system is still in its pilot phase, but it will allow refugees to verify their identity and access services more easily.

### Organization: `World Wildlife Fund for Nature`
Use case: `Supply chain tracking`

The blockchain is a transparent record of transactions, making it possible to verify the provenance of resources.
The WWF [OpenSC](https://opensc.org/) project uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of products such as palm oil and tuna, ensuring that consumers and businesses can verify a product‚Äôs origin, journey, and impact.

### Organization: `World Food Programme`
Use case: `Financial support`

The borderless nature of blockchain means that projects can raise funds easily and internationally, while donors can verify how their funds are used.
The WFP‚Äôs [Building Blocks](https://innovation.wfp.org/project/building-blocks) project uses blockchain to enable and track the distribution of cash assistance to refugees. It has assisted 1 million people in Jordan and Bangladesh and is being rolled out to other countries in the MENA region.

## When should civil society leaders consider experimenting with the DWeb?
DWeb proponents say that removing central control of the internet allows for distributed power and gives individual users more control over how they interact across the system. DWeb technology can be particularly valuable if this underlying ethos resonates with the work of your organization.

Here are five fundamentals that should be present when considering using the DWeb to build public good technology projects:

1. **Clear use case for the technology**
A crucial starting point to ensure that the project addresses a specific problem or opportunity that DWeb technology can effectively solve or enhance.

2. **Access to DWeb technical expertise**
The DWeb can be complex and requires specialized, technical knowledge to navigate its unique challenges.

3. **Long-term outlook**
Important for sustainability, as DWeb technology projects often need time to mature, gain adoption, and demonstrate their impact on users and communities.

4. **Builder mentality**
A proactive, hands-on approach to problem-solving and innovation is essential for navigating the dynamic and evolving DWeb landscape.

5. **Prepare for cultural change**
Anticipate and address the shift in mindset and behaviors that DWeb technology might require in your own organization (e.g., decentralized decision-making).
