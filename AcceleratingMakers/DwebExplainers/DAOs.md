# What Are DAOs?
>A Guide For Civil Society To Understand And Leverage Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are blockchain-based entities that enable programmable, transparent, and fair decision-making and resource management. DAOs decentralize decision-making by allowing all members and stakeholders of an organization to directly participate in governance, strategic direction, and resource allocation.

In this organizational model, members can communicate, vote, donate, and move funds using blockchain platforms to enhance transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. This reduces reliance on intermediaries, leading to more efficient resource distribution and increased trust. It also provides a flatter, more democratic structure than a traditional organization.

Embracing DAOs requires an in-depth understanding of blockchain technology and legal implications, but the potential to democratize and streamline civil society organizations' (CSO) operations makes it a vital path to consider for enhancing societal impact.

# Benefits
## 1. Decentralized Decision-Making

DAOs operate by consensus, where all participants come to an agreement, eliminating the need to trust a single central authority or individual. This structure reduces bureaucratic approval processes and allows for faster decision-making. In addition, it ensures fairness and integrity in decision-making while reducing the chance of a single point of failure.

## 2. Trust Through Transparency
With blockchain technology at the core of DAOs, all actions are recorded, providing an immutable and auditable ledger that instills confidence even in decentralized and anonymous interactions. This means that DAOs enable transparent decision-making among participants who may not know each other, allowing for increased levels of trust.

## 3. Rapid Fund Mobilization
DAOs use cryptocurrencies to allow large groups of people across many countries to quickly raise funds, pool resources, and execute initiatives without intermediaries. This agility is especially valuable for CSOs seeking rapid responses to social issues or emergencies, bypassing bureaucratic delays.

## 4. Inclusive Governance Structure 
DAOs represent a novel governance structure thatâ€™s less hierarchical and more inclusive. DAOs provide a level playing field for all stakeholders, regardless of location or position, to have a say in the organization's direction. This distributed decision-making aligns with the principles of fairness and openness held by many CSOs.

# How Your Organization Can Use DAOs
Leaders within CSOs can harness principles and structures of DAOs for various transformational and practical applications. 

## Restructure A Current Project
As a CSO, you could explore restructuring an existing community project into a DAO or including elements of DAO principles into your organizational structure. While there are risks and legal implications of completely restructuring, starting with a specific project might be an appropriate introduction to these concepts. This shift equally empowers employees and stakeholders, and it fosters inclusive and transparent decision-making. 

## Empower Donors And Stakeholders
Invite donors, volunteers, and other stakeholders into your organization by setting up a virtual community space, providing interested stakeholders the opportunity to engage and contribute. Going deeper, a blockchain system could record donations and use smart contracts to allow donors greater control over their contributions. They could set conditions for fund usage, so their donations are automatically released only when goals are achieved. 

## Facilitate Cross-Border Impact
If international work has been restricted due to banking and currency issues, you could use cryptocurrencies to expand operations to new locations. By adopting these blockchain funding opportunities, CSOs can enhance their efficiency, transparency, and global reach, ensuring their relevance in an increasingly digital world.

# Real-World Applications
## Ukraine DAO
[Ukraine DAO](https://ukraine-dao.notion.site/Ukraine-DAO-3a0e63c6190b4796890dec5c72a94872) emerged as a global collective during the Russian invasion in February 2022. Facing limitations on currency transfers, it auctioned an NFT of the Ukrainian flag, raising more than $7 million in five days. It has donated to support Ukraine and continues efforts â€” including a hackathon, translation work, and contributing evidence to the International Criminal Court. 

## Dream DAO
The [Dream DAO](https://www.dreamdao.xyz/) invests in the future of Web3 and social impact ecosystem by providing diverse Gen Zers around the globe with the training, funding, mentorship, and opportunities they need to leverage the power of Web3 to build a brighter future for humanity. They do this by fostering an intergenerational learning community for people ages 15 to 20 and placing the most committed young community members in meaningful paid internships at socially impactful Web3 organizations.

## Gitcoin
[Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) is a crowdfunding protocol for Web3 public goods and climate projects. The protocol is managed by the Gitcoin DAO, and anyone who holds Gitcoin's native token GTC can participate in its governance. It connects funders with projects, and through crowdfunding and token-based incentives, Gitcoin fosters collaboration and innovation within the open-source community, promoting sustainability and growth. The DAO has raised and distributed over $50 million and showcases the potential of blockchain technology to empower collective contributions to the open-source ecosystem.
