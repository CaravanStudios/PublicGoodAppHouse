# Using NFTs To Create Impact In Civil Society

>A Guide For Civil Society Leaders To Understand How NFTs Can Be Used For Public Good

# What Are NFTs?
Unlike cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, where each unit is interchangeable (similar to owning different dollar bills) non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership of one-of-a-kind items. This can include everything from digital art and fashion pieces, to digital credentials and identities, to physical assets like real estate or collectibles. NFTs serve as digital certificates of authenticity, verifying the uniqueness and ownership via transaction history on a blockchain, ensuring transparency and provenance. 

# How NFTs Work
Anyone is able to create an NFT by first selecting a blockchain platform, such as ethereum, and setting up a digital wallet to store cryptocurrency for transaction fees. Then, by paying the processing fees, an NFT minting platform or smart contract is used to transform the digital content into unique tokens on the blockchain. By listing NFTs on marketplaces, you can facilitate buying and selling, in which each subsequent transaction is recorded and linked to the previous. This creates a complete, up-to-date record of ownership starting from the origin that is immutable and transparent.

# Benefits
## Transparency and Authenticity
NFT transactions record ownership history on a blockchain, ensuring transparent provenance. This can be leveraged for authenticity verification, which is especially valuable in industries like art, music, and collectibles. This benefit is similar to that posed in supply chain traceability, which ensures that products are organic, come from ethical facilities, or are produced in sustainable ways.

## Monetization of Digital Assets
Monetization of digital assets has traditionally been difficult due to the ease of duplication and piracy. By creating NFTs of digital content, such as art, music, videos, or virtual goods like carbon credits, buyers have increased trust in the authenticity and the retained value of their ownership.

## Enhanced Brand Engagement
NFTs offer unique opportunities for fan engagement and loyalty. Organizations can issue limited-edition NFTs as rewards, stewardship pieces, incentives, or collectibles, fostering stronger connections with their audience. In these cases, NFTs can provide additional engagement and benefits over the lifetime of ownership, such as allowing access to a recurring event.

## Royalties and Secondary Sales
Smart contracts associated with NFTs can automate royalty payments to creators each time the NFT is resold. This ongoing revenue stream can benefit the creator, an artist, or a charity, even after the initial sale.

## Global Reach and Accessibility
NFTs are accessible to a global audience, removing geographical barriers and financial intermediaries. In fundraising, for example, organizations can tap into a broader market of buyers and collectors, expanding their reach beyond traditional boundaries.

# How CSOs Can Use NFTs
## Generate Funds and Engage Supporters
CSOs can create and sell exclusive NFTs related to their mission, offering a benefit or souvenir in exchange for financial support. These NFTs are particularly compelling when done in collaboration with artists and can even be programmed to create additional royalties paid to a CSO for each subsequent sale.

## Tokenize and Trade Impact Outcomes
NFTs can symbolize tangible impacts of CSO projects, creating a direct link between digital ownership and real-world change. By tokenizing impact outcomes, organizations can then trade them like carbon credits.

## Secure Historical Documents
CSOs can tokenize stories, historical documents, or educational content as NFTs, spreading their message, securing them, and promoting awareness. NFTs can also certify educational achievements like courses taken, events attended, or certificates received.

## Credentialing
CSOs can use NFTs for credentials across the organization to ensure that different staff members or stakeholders are able to access different areas, content, job levels, or voting and participatory rights.

# Real-World Applications
## Movember
[Movember](https://us.movember.com/story/world-s-first-non-fungible-testicles-nft-tokens), a men's health charity, innovatively leveraged NFTs for a life-saving cause. In a groundbreaking move, they introduced the Non-Fungible Testicles (NFT) project during Testicular Cancer Awareness Month. Partnering with art collective MISHKA NYC, they created evolving NFTs that encourage self-checks similar to real testicular exams. This initiative aimed to raise awareness among young males, who are at risk of testicular cancer but often lack knowledge. Proceeds from NFT sales supported testicular cancer research. The dynamic and interactive nature of NFTs provided a unique way to engage the crypto community, fostering behavior change while contributing to a vital cause.

## Hoseo University
[Hoseo University](https://crypto.news/hoseo-university-south-korea-nft-degree-diploma-certificates-2830/) in South Korea embraced NFT technology to issue degree and diploma certificates to 2,830 graduates. This initiative was intended to combat issues related to paper-based certificates, such as forgery and manipulation. By digitizing certificates as NFTs, the university enhanced transparency and security. The move not only modernized the certificate issuance process but also provided instant accessibility, promoting global access to education. This innovative application of NFTs showcased their potential to revolutionize traditional systems, promoting transparency and accessibility.

## Ixo
[The ixo Protocol](https://www.ixo.world/) defines a new standard for making verifiable impact claims to measure and report on how people and organizations are changing the state of the world, using high-definition data as evidence. These certified digital assets replace or enhance legacy instruments, such as verified emission reduction certificates. Impact producers use their verified data, proofs, and certified credentials to mint non-fungible impact credits.
