# Why Use Decentralized Storage In Civil Society?
>A Guide For Civil Society To Understand And Leverage Decentralized Storage For Increased Control

## What Is Decentralized Storage?
In centralized storage, data is held on a single server or group of servers that are controlled and maintained by a central authority. While commonly used because of its simplicity, centralized storage is also prone to security and reliability issues. In contrast, decentralized storage refers to an alternative system that doesn't rely on a central entity like traditional cloud providers. Instead, data is stored across a distributed network of nodes or servers, often over a blockchain-based system, where it leverages many participants' unused storage space across numerous locations or devices. 

Each participant in the network contributes storage space and computing resources, creating a resilient and tamper-resistant data repository. Essentially, you're buying storage on other people's computers, or offering excess storage on yours to other organizations. Transactions are often facilitated with storage tokens, a form of cryptocurrency that enables participants to receive rewards for offering their storage space.

## Benefits
Decentralized storage brings several benefits to organizations.

### Increased Security and Reliability
In a decentralized storage system, instead of storing data in one place, data is split across multiple locations, reducing the risk of complete data loss due to hardware failures or cyberattacks. CSOs can ensure the safety and availability of their critical information, and if an attack is successful, only a portion of the information will be compromised.

### Increased Data Privacy
With decentralized storage, CSOs have more control over their data. They can store sensitive information encrypted securely without relying on centralized providers, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

### Reduced Costs
Decentralized storage has been proven to cost 95 percent less than traditional public cloud services because CSOs only pay for the storage space they use. The system will then scale up if and when the organization needs more, freeing up resources for their core missions. 

### Improved Data Ownership
CSOs can maintain ownership and control of their data. They are not subject to the terms and conditions imposed by third-party providers and are more resistant to censorship because of this.

## How You Can Use Decentralized Storage
Individuals within CSOs can harness decentralized storage in practical ways to enhance their operations:

### Store Your Valuable Documents Securely
CSOs handle sensitive and valuable documents, such as donor records, confidential project reports, and legal documents. Decentralized storage offers a highly secure solution so you can store these documents in an encrypted format on decentralized networks, which are resistant to data breaches and cyberattacks due to their distributed nature. 

### Monetize Your Excess Storage Space
Decentralized storage networks allow individuals and organizations to contribute their unused storage space in exchange for payments in cryptocurrency. If you own and maintain your own data storage system, you can capitalize on this by leasing out excess storage capacity you might have. The earned cryptocurrency can be reinvested in the organization, potentially generating additional funds for your mission.

### Encrypt More of Your Data
Beyond the benefits of distributed data, moving to blockchain-based storage also ensures that your data is safeguarded with robust encryption. Even in the event of a system failure or a malicious attack, decentralized storage maintains data integrity, guaranteeing that your documents stay protected and accessible to the right people.

### Share Information Without Limitation
Decentralized storage reduces dependence on centralized providers, reducing the risk of censorship or data loss due to service interruptions. You can freely store and access documents without concerns about third-party interference. This is especially crucial for organizations that operate in regions with strict regulations, that are concerned about censorship, or that face potential threats to their data's integrity.

### Implement a Data Backup and Disaster Recovery System
Decentralized storage acts as a robust backup solution. You can use it to easily create redundant copies of important documents without needing parallel systems. This ensures that data is available even in the face of natural disasters or hardware failures, which bolsters disaster recovery and maintains your organization's continuity.

## Real-World Applications
### ARWeave 
Hong Kong activists are preserving Apple Daily's pro-democracy articles on [ARWeave](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kongs-apple-daily-live-blockchain-free-censors-2021-06-24/), a decentralized blockchain platform, following the newspaper's closure due to national security law crackdowns. Under this law, Hong Kong's government can request content removal, raising concerns over internet freedom. Fearing increased censorship, activists have uploaded over 4,000 articles to ARWeave. Additionally, programmer Kin Ko developed LikeCoin, a decentralized registry that allows users to verify content metadata and detect changes. These efforts showcase how blockchain-based decentralized storage can protect free speech and information in the face of increasing censorship and government crackdowns.

### Filecoin
[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is a decentralized, blockchain-based storage network that aims to create a more efficient and secure system for storing and retrieving digital information. Built-in economic incentives ensure that files are stored and retrieved reliably and continuously. It has gained attention and support from the blockchain community for its potential to disrupt traditional cloud storage services. Filecoin is powering innovative solutions like OpenDEI, a global data commons initiative, storing and sharing COVID-19 data securely, showcasing the potential of decentralized storage for large-scale, collaborative, and secure data management.

### MuckRock
[MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/)'s partnership with FFDW brings decentralized storage to DocumentCloud, enhancing transparency and accessibility. This collaboration empowers users, including newsrooms and nonprofits, to preserve and share vital documents securely. The initiative focuses on simplified decentralization, intuitive automation, and expanding civil society partnerships, making data resilience and accessibility a priority.
