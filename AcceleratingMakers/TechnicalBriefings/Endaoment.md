## The Problem: Direct Charitable Giving on the Decline

For charities, there is one thing that is almost always in the forefront of their operational planning: fundraising. But fundraising has become increasingly difficult with factors such as the decline in the average size of gifts and the rise of new giving vehicles like donor-advised funds (DAFs).

In the United States, for example, there has been a steady decline in the average size of charitable donations as well as in the overall number of households that donate to nonprofits. From May 2022 to May 2023, 50% of donors said they’d given less to charity specifically due to increases in their costs of living. In 2022, charitable giving by individuals dropped by 3.4%. When adjusted for inflation, giving declined by 10.5%.[^1]

This is doubly significant when the fact that the majority of donations come from individuals. In 2022, the largest source of charitable giving was from individuals, who gave $319.04 billion, representing 64% of total giving.[^2] As donations trend downwards, it becomes important for organizations to find new revenue and donation sources, lower costs, and add new incentives to donate.

Compounding this challenge is the trend of individuals transitioning to DAFs. DAFs are a financial vehicle that enables a donor to commit money to charity and receive an immediate tax receipt without immediately transferring funds to a charity.[^3] This form of giving is growing rapidly, and already makes up 22% of individual giving.[^4] DAFs pose a challenge to traditional charitable fundraising models. DAFs act as “black boxes,” anonymizing donations and limiting charties’ ability to form direct relationships with donors, hindering their capacity to solicit ongoing gifts.[^5] As a result, charities are struggling to identify and access the growing pool of funds held in DAFs.

Another source of untapped charitable giving is the funds sitting in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is estimated that $2.6 trillion is currently invested in cryptocurrencies. However, most nonprofits don’t understand the interests of this potential donor class and lack the knowledge and tools to accept gifts in cryptocurrencies.[^6] 


## The Solution: A Smart Contract–Powered Donation Platform with Support for DAFs

Enter Endaoment. Endaoment is a nonprofit community foundation and public charity whose donation platform is built with distributed web technology. Because Endaoment is also a foundation itself, it not only collects donations for organizations, it also hosts DAFs, which, in turn, donate on a regular basis to the nonprofits that are also active on the platform.[^7] It also accepts donations in cash, credit card, cryptocurrencies, stocks, fiat currencies, real estate, and more.[^8] This represents a sizable expansion in the kinds of donations that can be collected by a single platform, particularly in the case of cryptocurrencies. 

Additionally, the Endaoment platform is centered on the Ethereum blockchain. It is powered entirely by smart contracts, a type of digital agreement that is specific to the blockchains themselves. Blockchains are also highly transparent, with every transaction adding a new “block” to the chain of transactions. These blocks, or transactions, are open and transparent in a way that has not existed in financial systems before.[^9] Users have the ability to access those transactions using a block explorer, which shows all of the details belonging to a transaction in order to see exactly where donations come from and go to. There is no mystery, additional fees, or questions about how the donations themselves are handled.


## Case Study: Doctors Without Borders

Since becoming active on Endaoment, Doctors Without Borders has collected $431,000[^10] of donations via 29 transactions. Only five of those were direct donations by individuals. The rest of them are from DAFs that are managed on the Endaoment platform. This is atypical of the usual scenario for donations, in which individual donors make up the bulk of donations to nonprofits.

Not only can these transactions be seen on Endaoment in list form, but the full details themselves are also available.[^11] By leveraging blockchain technology, Endaoment is able to create greater transparency as well as automate the matching of DAFs to charitable organizations.
