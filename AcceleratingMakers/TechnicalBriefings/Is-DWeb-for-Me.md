# Is DWeb for Me?


### 6 Key Questions Nonprofits Should Ask to Evaluate Decentralized Technologies

_7-9 minute read._

Are you concerned about the privacy and security of your organization's data? Do you worry about the potential risks of relying on for-profit technology tools due to concerns over ads, high fees, data control, or harmful surveillance practices? If so, you're not alone. Many nonprofits are exploring alternatives to traditional tech solutions, and decentralized web (DWeb) technologies are gaining attention as a promising option.

In this guide, we'll help you understand what DWeb is and provide you with the most important questions you should ask your technical team when evaluating whether decentralized technologies are a good fit for your organization’s needs. 


## What Is DWeb, and Why Should Nonprofits Care?

Unlike centralized platforms like Google and Facebook, which store data on their own servers and have the power to censor content or sell user data to advertisers, DWeb technologies distribute data across a network of nodes and give users greater control over their information. **In decentralized environments, no single entity has the power to modify, delete, or manipulate the data stored on these servers.** 

From our research, and many conversations with civil society leaders, we know that nonprofits need to collect and store lots of different types of data in order to accomplish their goals. However, we have also learned how important it is for **the technologies handling this potentially sensitive data to be aligned with the values of your organization and respectful of the rights of the communities you serve.** DWeb tools can be rights-respecting alternatives to for-profit technologies worth considering, but certainly not without a deep understanding of the risks and benefits.

For nonprofits considering DWeb tools, we recommend bringing this guide into conversations with technical teams to use as a conversation resource. By answering these questions together, technical and nontechnical leaders will hopefully be able to better communicate about stakeholder needs and priorities and make more informed decisions about integrating DWeb into an organization’s tech stack.


## Questions for Evaluating DWeb Technologies

Begin by reflecting on two initial questions:



1. What type of data, if any, do we collect from our constituents, and what purpose does it serve towards accomplishing our mission (such as personal, demographic, health, education, social, program participation, financial, correspondences, online interaction, etc.)? 
2. How do our technological tools handle this data, and are we giving our constituents as much control and transparency over their data as possible?

In general, a good guiding principle is **data minimization**: a nonprofit (and therefore the technology tools it leverages) should limit data collection, as best it can, to **only what is necessary for the nonprofit’s operations and mission. **

Here are six of the key questions to consider when evaluating whether DWeb is right for your organization.

<h3>Privacy</h3>

DWeb privacy involves safeguarding user data from corporate or government surveillance. Decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are usually run by nonprofits or volunteers and provide more options for controlling data access within networks. Also, many decentralized services offer strong encryption, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read the messages.
<p>
<strong>Ask:</strong> How personal or sensitive is the data we are collecting, and is it information likely to be subject to state or corporate surveillance? What additional (not necessary) data or metadata might be being collected as well? What are the privacy policies of the tools we are using to collect and store our constituents’ data? What could happen if this data is leaked? Does the platform sell user data (to data brokers, advertisers, etc.)? How would these companies respond to government subpoenas? Is the data encrypted and secured within the decentralized systems?
<p>
For highly sensitive data or communities vulnerable to privacy invasion, <strong>consider DWeb</strong>.
   </td>
   <td rowspan="2" >
<h3>Immutability</h3>

Immutability, in the context of DWeb, refers to the quality of data that prevents it from being changed or modified once it has been recorded. Once data is added to a distributed network, it is duplicated across many nodes and verified using consensus protocols. This ensures that once something is published to the DWeb, it can't be arbitrarily altered or removed by any single party. 
<p>
<strong>Ask:</strong> Does the data need to be constantly changed or updated, or is it a relatively unchanging dataset of information? Is there a high need for long-term availability or preservation of the data? Is there any risk to the data being immutable?
<p>
If the data needs to be deleted or redacted after publishing, DWeb tools may not be a good option. For data that is relatively unchanging (such as archives and historical records), <strong>consider DWeb.</strong>

<h3>Security</h3>

DWeb security is characterized by the absence of a single point of failure. Unlike centralized systems, which have vulnerable points of attack (“supernodes”), decentralized networks distribute control across various nodes. This distribution mitigates the risk of service interruptions if certain nodes are compromised. 
<p>
<strong>Ask:</strong> What measures are taken to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering in a decentralized environment? How do we manage access control in decentralized systems? What are some possible threats to the system that could make the data vulnerable (such as Internet shutdowns, DDoS attacks or other types of malicious cyberattacks, natural disasters, etc.)? 
<p>
For data at risk of being lost due to service interruptions, tampering (supply chain data, property rights, etc.), or other attacks, <strong>consider DWeb.</strong>
   </td>
   <td>
<h3>Censorship Resistance</h3>

Censorship resistance is a key feature of DWeb technologies because when data is distributed across multiple nodes, it reduces reliance on centralized servers under the control of a single government or organization with the ability to take down content. Distributed ledger technology can also be used to record transactions and ensure legitimacy, making it more challenging to alter or censor data.
<p>
<strong>Ask: </strong>Are we currently (or are we at risk for) being censored for our advocacy or outreach (on social media, email, or other communication platforms)? Are we facing service denial (for example from financial services such as banks and payment processors or web hosting providers)? Are we facing algorithmic bias or discrimination?
<p>
For data likely to face censorship, <strong>consider DWeb</strong>.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<h3>Transparency and Trust</h3>

Transparency in the DWeb implies that all transactions and data are visible to participants (unless encrypted), which ensures trust and accountability to stakeholders. Transparency can also refer to the open-source code on which the systems usually run, which allows anyone to see how the system works and even contribute to the underlying source code.
<p>
<strong>Ask:</strong> Is trust in the system a key issue for our stakeholders? How can we make the information and actions within a system visible and understandable to authorized parties?
<p>
For data that is public information, or systems that should remain accountable to their users, <strong>consider DWeb.</strong>
   </td>
   <td>
<h3>Decentralized Governance and Collective Input</h3>

Decentralized networks encourage collaborative and participatory governance as opposed to more traditional hierarchical models commonly found in centralized systems. On the technical level, there are “consensus mechanisms” that ensure that all nodes in the network agree that all transactions are valid. On the human level, decentralized organizations can more easily program participatory and democratic decision-making processes into the technology (such as with smart contracts).
<p>
<strong>Ask:</strong> Are there any collective decision-making processes we need to conduct in order to govern this technology? What type of governance does our organization use and does it align well with the nonhierarchical, horizontal nature of decentralized technologies? 
<p>
For organizations that value horizontal as opposed to vertical leadership or those that conduct participatory or decentralized governance processes, <strong>consider DWeb</strong>.

   <td rowspan="2" colspan="2" ><strong>Other Considerations for Discussion:</strong>
<ul>

<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Many decentralized technologies, due to their open-source nature, have no licensing fees, making them cost-effective options for nonprofits with limited budgets.  
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Ask</strong>: What is the cost of this tool relative to centralized alternatives?
</li> 
</ul>

<li><strong>Function in Offline Environments:</strong> Some peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies do not require a strong Internet connection to work, making them a good option for remote communities. 
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Ask:</strong> What are our needs when it comes to serving remote communities or those subject to Internet shutdowns or other service interruptions?
</li> 
</ul>

<li><strong>Legal Compliance or Reputational Concern:</strong>
