# DWeb for Community Archives White Paper

_May 2024_


## Executive Summary

This white paper explores the potential of decentralized web (DWeb) solutions for community archives based on insights gathered from interviews with 11 community archivists. While DWeb technology offers compelling benefits such as increased privacy, security, and community ownership, there are also significant challenges and concerns that need to be addressed before widespread adoption. This document aims to provide civil society executives with a clear understanding of the opportunities and obstacles in implementing DWeb solutions for community archives.


## Introduction

Community archives play a vital role in documenting, preserving, and making accessible the diverse histories of specific local, occupational, ethnic, faith, and other communities.[^1] By collecting various materials like documents, photographs, and oral histories that reflect the unique experiences of these groups, community archives contribute significantly to the preservation and inclusivity of local and national heritage. These collective initiatives are particularly important for marginalized or underrepresented groups whose experiences have traditionally been excluded from mainstream archives.[^2]

Through our interviews, we learned that the growth of internet technologies has enabled community archivists to digitize and share their collections more easily. However, reliance on cloud-based solutions can be costly, impractical in communities with limited internet access, and risky when entrusting sensitive data to centralized providers. As a result, there is a growing interest among community archivists and civil society leaders in exploring decentralized web solutions that prioritize community ownership.


## The Basics of DWeb

DWeb technology is built on the underlying premise that digital data can and should be owned and controlled by its users instead of centralized entities.[^3] With internet data and applications distributed across a network of connected devices, this movement aims to offer increased transparency, privacy, and security among other benefits.

In most cases, this is achieved through blockchain technology, a record of transactions maintained by a distributed network of users, enabling peer-to-peer interactions and information sharing without intermediarie.[^4] DWeb and blockchain technology are what afford us the ability to create decentralized currency, data storage, and governance. For community archivists, the latter two are the most applicable, promising improved digital sovereignty.


## How Can DWeb Support Community Archives?[^5]


### Avoiding Reliance on Large Tech Companies

DWeb technologies present a compelling opportunity to avoid reliance solely on corporate and centralized digital solutions for two main reasons. 

First, there is a growing distrust and ideological mismatch between community archivists and the ad-driven business model of large technology companies. Community archives that rely on corporate cloud-based solutions are concerned about them accessing, using, and profiting from their data in different capacities. Large technology companies employ algorithms and tracking mechanisms to “harvest” user data to create targeted advertising profiles. And more recently, the lack of information and transparency around AI training further increases the level of distrust. One interviewee mentions, “I do think a lot of the revolutionary aspect of the internet has been lost because it's such a corporate wasteland right now. Like, literally everything is an ad, even if it's not an ad.” 

Secondly, relying on one, or even several, private company solutions to create a community archive poses a risk to longevity. While many people will select technology from large brands for the reputation and reliability, they are still susceptible to product, policy, or pricing changes. Community archives are long-term projects with ever-increasing amounts of data that can become difficult to move. One interviewee reported, “We can’t leave, we’re locked in.” This creates a general fear that the service they’re using could change in the future, causing issues for the community archive.

A deeper look at the lock-in effect also shows the lack of interoperability provided by most cloud-based solutions. Corporate solutions typically only offer interoperability when it is profitable for the company to do so. However, free and open-source software isn’t always an improvement either. One community archivist commented, “Although Omeka-S is a free and decentralized software, it still doesn’t interoperate, making it just a public utility self-hosted software.” DWeb solutions like Filecoin have the potential to be an improvement, as every transaction is interoperable and immutable, making it a more reliable technology for community archives.

DWeb technology offers the promise of building independent digital public infrastructure that prioritizes privacy, autonomy and security, ensuring community ownership and digital sovereignty.[^6]


### Moving to Community Ownership

Community archivists consistently advocate for self-ownership of data.[^7] They have a vested interest in how their information is stored, presented, and they should have the ability to control the dissemination of this information. 

The goal of community archives is to foster autonomy and locally based solutions rather than to profit from the publication of data. At a high level, the data can be considered as belonging to “the community.” This position is well aligned with the decentralized web and popular models of data sovereignty in DWeb circles.[^8]

However, when speaking with interviewees about it more specifically, community archivists make it clear that the individual contributors actually retain ownership of the data. This poses issues covered later in this white paper about problems with immutability and contributor data ownership. 


### Improving Privacy and Anonymity

In the realm of community archives, privacy and anonymity are of paramount importance. DWeb technologies can offer enhanced privacy through anonymized contribution and also ensure that data is not stored in a central location. This decentralized approach allows community archives to safeguard sensitive information and uphold the privacy of the individuals and communities they represent.

Additionally, with a mission to make community heritage data widely accessible, community archives could benefit from anonymity of end users. As the interviews reveal, most data made available by these community archives is used for expanding and building awareness on specific issues, and their materials are used in court cases, documentaries, and to develop local community networks. The information can be sensitive, including reporting of police violence, protest activities, or issues with public institutions, all of which could pose significant risks if users’ identities are exposed. 


### Increasing Resiliency

A primary feature of DWeb solutions is their inherent resiliency, where multiple copies of the file are stored in different locations dispersed throughout the network. This makes the data less likely to be lost or modified due to breaches, hacks, censorship, natural disasters, or institutional evolution.


## What’s Holding Back DWeb Development?


### Lack of Technical Expertise

Community archives often lack the resources and funding to attract and integrate technical talent with expertise in DWeb implementation. One interviewee noted: “Small archives do not have personnel versed in digital technologies to redesign a new information infrastructure. … At our organization, there is one person [the webmaster] that deals with most technological-related issues and solutions at the organization.”

Another interviewee explained how the challenge of competing for talent then creates a new situation, where small organizations “are forced to partner with larger institutions so that they can have access to their storage capacity, … and their technical expertise, archivists, digital archivists, or staff.” Institutional partnerships only add to the complexity of making a technology change.

In addition, the lack of expertise runs deeper than just technical implementation. Even if DWeb technology was available from a funding perspective, the sector’s general knowledge about DWeb is still in its infancy. As one of the interviewees expressed, “It is not in our language or dialect” [and most personnel in community archives] “... still cannot comprehend what it means to even be decentralized, much less like blockchain and all that sort of stuff.” The knowledge gap between DWeb advocates and participants in community-based archives means only the most pioneering early adopters will experiment with these new tools — until the benefits of DWeb are better understood by the wider community and the user experience barriers are minimized. 


### User Experience Gaps

DWeb solutions are currently more complicated and less intuitive than mainstream consumer or enterprise apps, which is hindering adoption among community archives. Consumers have grown to expect intuitive user experiences because they interact with them every day on smartphones and social media apps.

As referenced in a previous research report, [Decentralized Web — Challenges to Use and Access](https://pages.techsoup.org/hubfs/Maker%20Labs/Makers_Arc2_TechSoup_Report.pdf), “You need to be able to explain something to your grandma in less than 5 minutes.”[^9] DWeb solutions for community archives should follow similar attention to design, but these customized solutions might be more difficult to match common expectations. 

Furthermore, solutions might not be as simple as copying apps designed for the masses. For example, an interviewee in India stated that some of the people that the archive serves can’t read, but they know how to interact with smartphone apps and social media platforms. As Costanza-Chock writes, community archives embody the ethos of “nothing about us without us.”[^10] With this, community archive apps should be designed with both common user design and unique community needs in mind. This finding points to the need for DWeb developers and implementers to include a broader and more representative set of users in their design process and not only in the testing phase of software-related products.


### Concerns About Immutability, Privacy, and Safety

Immutability is generally considered a benefit of DWeb technology. With permanent records that prove origin and verification on the blockchain, most people appreciate the improved transparency, trust, and authenticity. But community archivists have a different perspective that introduces a major barrier to adoption, particularly as immutability is an inherent property of DWeb and blockchain technology.

They see immutability of decentralized storage as posing significant potential for harm to communities that might be victims of systemic violence as a result of policy change, regime change, or simply being discovered by bad actors. With a lower tolerance for risk, community-based archives differ from standard archiving institutions such as the ones housed in universities, maintained by the government and other large institutions. Community archivists “believe that archives are stewards of public knowledge, not owners of anything,” says one interviewee. This means they hold a responsibility to their community members in how data is managed.

“We were more concerned with the sort of risks and threats of tech advances broadly, and sort of what it meant for our work and our archival materials, and especially the people that we work with,” says an interviewee. “That becomes a problem with the permanence issue around decentralized storage, or blockchain storage in that it's, you know, there's no way to really go in and remove anything.”

In positioning themselves as data stewards instead of data owners, community archives need to be able to delete publicly available information or implement a “takedown policy” should the data contributor request it.[^11]

“We've made it very intentional that we share ownership with the record creator. So whoever is donating the story or the materials, they own it, and we make sure in our consent and donation forms, that that is very clear, and that they have full control over to what extent and for how long their materials are in a public archive,” an interviewee explained.

The community archivists that were interviewed emphasized the crucial role of anonymity, as they often handle sensitive content and topics. This stance was particularly resonant among archives situated in regions with stringent laws and regulations governing issues such as gender and sexuality. Because of the important and often dangerous work performed by such archives, legal retaliation and even arrest are among the consequences they risk in order to continue to collect and present stories of their communities.

These concerns pose serious implications for people working on building DWeb-based community archives. In one interview, it was mentioned that they no longer use the words _decentralized web_, opting for the words _distributed web_ instead. While the definitions and differences between the two may not be clear, it reiterates the hesitation they hold because of their foundational concerns about immutability and safety. 


## Conclusion

Community archives are looking for models of data storage and management that don’t rely solely on centralized service providers. The ideological differences make it difficult for archivists to trust large technology companies, and a community-owned solution is increasingly more attractive as these archives grow. DWeb technology presents a compelling opportunity that has the potential to serve many of their needs.

However, there are significant barriers and concerns to address before they’re ready to adopt such a technology. The general understanding of DWeb and blockchain solutions is far from adequate, and funding required to hire highly specialized professionals to support these systems is a significant barrier to broader adoption. The biggest concern though, is with a foundational principle of DWeb technology: immutability. Community archives believe the contributors own the data, that archives are stewards of the data, and they need to respect requests to delete information — a task not easily completed in decentralized storage with immutable records.

Many community archivists are hopeful that solutions will emerge for them. Moving forward, there’s an opportunity for DWeb builders to engage directly with community archivists throughout the development process to ensure that solutions align with the unique needs and values of these organizations. By working together, civil society leaders and DWeb technologists can create solutions that empower community archives to preserve and share their histories while prioritizing privacy, security, and community ownership.

     According to this interviewee, “takedown policy” is a form of language borrowed from archival studies and communities. As this research participant noted, DWeb and community-based archives form a new intersection, and a new language will likely emerge to bridge these two areas [See: Urban, J. (2016). Takedown and Today’s Academic Digital Library].
