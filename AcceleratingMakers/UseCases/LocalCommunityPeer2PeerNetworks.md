# DWeb Use Cases for Civil Society

## Local Community / Peer-to-Peer Networks

The fundamental architecture behind blockchains and other decentralized technology is called a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A P2P network is a distributed network of computers (nodes) that can communicate directly with each other in contrast to a client-server model where the server operates as a centralized system serving many clients. 

P2P networks are powerful because there is no single point of failure or network control. If one node in the network breaks down or gets hacked, the network will be able to maintain functionality. Also, P2P networks are not subject to the client-server model bottlenecks around an individual server that could experience slow, limited service or even a complete crash.

Decentralized technologies built on P2P networks can be used to support underserved or geographically remote communities by delivering internet access, circumventing censorship, preserving message privacy, and building network strength.

## Use Cases (Jobs To Be Done)

### 1. Mapping Remote Territory

Indigenous communities around the world are protecting natural resources, biodiversity, and the lands they live on. However, they face threats such as illegal gold mining, oil contamination, and poaching. Technological solutions are emerging to help them document features of their land (photos, videos, maps), report key information to authorities, launch media campaigns, and even win legal claims and battles that have secured their governance rights over their lands. Decentralized technologies are helping communities in more remote areas without internet access because they can enable more local, peer-to-peer (P2P) data storage systems which are useful to vulnerable populations with sensitive data.


#### Example: [Mapeo](https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo) (Digital Democracy)

Mapeo is a free, easy-to-use, open source set of tools for collecting and mapping information. It was designed to work in entirely offline environments, is highly customizable, and built on a decentralized peer-to-peer database that allows communities to own their own data.

### 2. Community Wi-Fi Networks

Community Wi-Fi networks refer to interconnected collections of nodes (routers, clients, and gateways) and devices (laptops, cell phones, and other wireless devices) that provide internet access without the need for traditional internet service providers (ISPs). Unlike these traditional ISPs, decentralized community Wi-Fi networks do not rely on transmissions of signals being directed through any centralized corporate-owned hub. Instead, the community Wi-Fi network is decentralized and often collectively owned and managed by the community. This gives communities access to cost effective, sustainable, resilient, and net neutral broadband internet for their neighborhoods.

#### Example: [NYC Mesh](https://www.nycmesh.net)

NYC Mesh is a community Wi-Fi initiative that offers an affordable way to circumvent ISPs and bring high-speed internet access to underserved neighborhoods—without harvesting and reselling user data. Whereas most Wi-Fi services rely on a few access points, or hotspots, mesh networks use hundreds of smaller nodes, which collaborate to pass data along the network.

### 3  Private Browsing

Web browsers are among the types of software applications that can be built atop decentralized networks of servers operated and governed by a diversity of volunteer notes. DWeb browsers can be more private, censorship-resistant and surveillance-free than their corporate-owned alternatives such as Google Chrome and Apple’s Safari.

DWeb browsers are usually built with software that is free and open in order to maximize transparency and decentralization. Also, web traffic and information is encrypted at each step of the way so that the IP addresses of people who use it are completely private. These browsers have been extremely important for human rights organizations by making anonymity and privacy technologies usable internationally.


##### Example: [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org)


Tor was an instrumental tool during the Arab Spring beginning in late 2010. It not only protected people's identity online but also allowed them to access critical resources, social media, and websites which were blocked.

### 4. Censorship-Resistant Media

Today, centralized platforms wield disproportionate power to control what we see and what we say. Large social media platforms have become notorious for removing content from marginalized communities without warning, explanation, or accountability measures. The DWeb offers an alternative place for content creators, writers, activists, journalists, frontline communities, and more to share media online without needing to rely on centralized corporate-owned servers or platforms. DWeb technology enables people to own and control their own data, move their data to different apps that easily work together, and post important information in the format they want with no one monitoring or censoring.


Within the DWeb ecosystem are a variety of developer sub-communities that have formed around specific projects or “specifications” having to do with the publication and dissemination of media. For example, the IndieWeb is a community dedicated to ensuring creator ownership over their own domains and content through the development of personal websites connected by simple standards. Another well-known DWeb sub-community is the Fediverse. Where the IndieWeb is mostly concerned with individual domain ownership, the Fediverse intends to enable easy exchange of information through a network of independently hosted servers that are interoperable (can talk to each other) through shared standards. The protocol that runs the Fediverse is known as ActivityPub. Different applications are then built on top of the IndieWeb and the Fediverse with their own functionalities, UX, and (sub)-sub-communities. See example applications below.


#### Example: [Distributed Press](https://distributed.press/) (IndieWeb)


Distributed Press is a beginner friendly, open-source publishing tool for the Dweb. Aiming to empower authors, Distributed Press utilizes the distributed web to amplify free expression worldwide, while exposing sources of misinformation.


According to the [Distributed Press docs](https://docs.distributed.press/about/vision), “Publishing to the DWeb means that instead of a single provider hosting your content, anyone on the web can choose to seed and help co-host your content as well. This means your content becomes much more resilient to censorship. Distributed Press in particular, provides a server that helps seed this content to ensure that there is at least one provider of the data when someone tries to view your content, which greatly increases the availability of the content.”

#### Example: [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en_US) (Fediverse)

PeerTube is a free and open-source video platform that serves as a decentralized alternative to Youtube or Vimeo. PeerTube is part of the Fediverse, meaning users can set up their own streaming sites and run them independently or link (federate) them with other PeerTube instances through the ActivityPub standard and using P2P technology.

Unlike on corporate-owned social media apps, content you post on the Fediverse can be passed through to other Fediverse platforms with no “walled gardens” keeping you locked in. For example, users of another Fediverse platform, Mastodon, can follow PeerTube users and comment on videos in a seamless, interconnected way.
