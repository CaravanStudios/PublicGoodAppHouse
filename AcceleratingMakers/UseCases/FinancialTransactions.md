#  DWeb Use Cases for Civil Society

## Financial Transactions

One of the most powerful use cases of decentralized technologies for civil society is in financial transactions. Nonprofit organizations can benefit from the advantages provided by blockchains and other DWeb technologies including security, speed, and transparency.

Blockchains are essentially online databases distributed across a network of computers that are not owned by any central authority. Instead of relying on governmental or financial institutions, transactions on a blockchain are recorded and verified by the members of this peer network, which ensures that they are accurate and cannot be altered.

When it comes to fundraising, budgeting, and disbursing funds, there are many applications that leverage decentralized technologies that nonprofits can use to support these processes. Decentralized technologies include blockchains, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, smart contracts, digital wallets, and even non-blockchain peer-to-peer, transparent, free, and open-source technology (FOSS).

Here are some of the financial use cases for decentralized technologies.


## Fundraising

Many nonprofits are now accepting and processing crypto donations through the availability of lots of different types of tools. Accepting crypto donations enables nonprofits to generate new revenue streams, reach new segments of donors, and fuel their organization's mission. With more than 300 million crypto users worldwide, accepting cryptocurrency donations can help nonprofits engage young millennial and Generation Z donors.

### Example: [The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com)

The Giving Block is the largest online platform helping nonprofits to accept noncash donations like crypto and stocks. It provides 2,000+ nonprofits with specific crypto exchange accounts, which enable them to receive payments quickly and securely. Nonprofits can choose to quickly convert cryptocurrency donations to U.S. dollars or, alternatively, hold onto it. The Giving Block also provides customer service support to nonprofits and their donors as well as running large marketing campaigns to drive more donations.

## Participatory Grant Making and Community Funds

Along with direct donations and donor advised funds, community funds allow nonprofits to receive crypto donations. Community funds offer the same perks as donating to a DAF, but the grant recipients are chosen collectively by a group or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which can help maximize impact.

### Example: [Endaoment](https://endaoment.org/)

Endaoment enables nonprofits to easily and securely receive crypto-native donations at scale through direct donations as well as through a network of donor advised and community funds.

[Computer Cowgirls](https://www.computercowgirls.io), an art activism collective, donated the smart contract and artwork from their second NFT collection to Endaoment. The platform received all proceeds from NFT sales and enabled CowgirlDAO, the philanthropic arm of Computer Cowgirls, to vote on which charities would receive the funds, with a focus on organizations that provide abortion access. Other community funds [on Endaoment](https://docs.endaoment.org/donors/community-funds) include Stand with Asians Community Fund and Crypto Carbon Offset Fund.

## Public Goods Funding

In blockchain communities, public goods are hugely important, including open-source software/client code, protocol research, documentation, and community building. Many blockchain technology projects are aimed at creating mechanisms for public goods funding and support. Many nonprofits are generating public goods, so using this technology might be useful and well aligned.

### Example: [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) / [Public Goods Network (PGN)](https://publicgoods.network/)

Gitcoin builds software tools to enable communities to build, fund, and protect what matters to them. Builders creating communities or grants programs can use Gitcoin's Grants Stack and Allo Protocol software. They also run their own grants program for public goods having distributed over $50 million in grants (3.8 million unique donations) to early-stage projects in the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond. Gitcoin is built on top of the Public Goods Network blockchain.

## Humanitarian Cash Aid Transfers

Humanitarian aid organizations are using blockchain technology to transfer cash assistance securely and cost-efficiently to refugees and people around the world recovering from conflict, disasters, and the impact of climate change. 

### Example: [Building Blocks](https://innovation.wfp.org/project/building-blocks)

Building Blocks is a humanitarian blockchain originally built by the World Food Programme (WFP) that is now owned and operated by a network of participating organizations who use it to collaborate, transact, and securely share information in real time. Building Blocks builds applications on the blockchain network that enable tracking, coordination, and delivery of multiple types of assistance to people in need, including cash, food, WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene), medicine, and more. Four million people are supported by Building Blocks every month with over $325 million in cash assistance provided in countries including Bangladesh, Jordan, Lebanon, and Ukraine, saving $3 million in bank fees.

## Banking the Unbanked: [Digital Microwork](https://innovation.wfp.org/project/digital-microwork)

Through the use of blockchain technology, young people from marginalized communities are being connected with income opportunities such as performing routine IT tasks via freelance microwork platforms. Even if they don't have access to formal financial institutions and don't have bank accounts to receive payments, they can still earn money in a digital crypto-based wallet.

### Example: [EMPACT](https://innovation.wfp.org/project/empact)

EMPACT is a World Food Programme innovation project that connects young people from food-insecure communities to the digital economy. In Kibera, Africa's largest urban slum, located in Kenya, the students are trained to perform routine IT tasks via freelance microwork platforms. In doing so, they can earn income online and afford to buy food and pay for their own housing when there are no opportunities open in the local job market.

EMPACT utilized the open-source blockchain platform [Celo](https://celo.org) to give students access to digital crypto-based accounts. They also partnered with [Corsali](https://medium.com/virtuous-ventures/corsali-founders-series-991dd20436ee), a machine learning platform that makes digital microwork accessible on a mobile device. Together, these two elements enable students to do microwork even from their smartphones and get paid in stablecoins, which can be converted to local currencies easily without losing much on transaction fees.

## Reducing Liquidity Shortages (Community Inclusion Currencies)

Blockchain-based tokens are being introduced into local economies that have been impacted by economic crises and are experiencing shortages of national currency in order to serve as a substitute for these classical liquidities. Known as [Community Inclusion Currencies](https://innovation.wfp.org/project/community-inclusion-currencies) (CICs), these tokens work to develop a source of local credit through a complementary monetary system that fosters consumption within the community by supporting both consumers (to cope with basic needs) and local businesses.

Distributed ledger technology provides the underlying protocols to secure user accounts, and [USSD technology](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/USSD#:~:text=USSD%20(Unstructured%20Supplementary%20Service%20Data)%20is%20a%20Global%20System%20for,used%20to%20send%20text%20messages.) enables any cellphone (even without internet) to have access. Due to the distributed nature and integrated cryptography of blockchain models, CIC transaction records are immutable and secure. Fraud attempts or saving excessive amounts of tokens are prevented by a holding-fee tool as well as regulations ensuring that tokens circulate only within the community. 

### Example: [The Sarafu Network](https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/pages/sarafu-network) (Community Currency in Kenya)

The Sarafu Network in Kenya is one of the largest blockchain networks in Kenya and is purposefully trying to grow and improve local communities. It is a collaboration between Kenya Red Cross, Danish Red Cross, and the Grassroots Economic Foundation and has been an ongoing project for over a decade.

[Grassroots Economics explains Sarafu-Credit](https://geo.coop/story/kenyas-sarafu-credit) as: “A network of businesses, schools, self-employed and informal sector workers form a cooperative whose profits and inventory are issued as vouchers for social and environmental services as well as an interest-free credit to community members. These vouchers circulate in the community and can be used at any shop, school, clinic or cooperative businesses and form a stable medium of exchange when the Kenyan Shilling is lacking. This injection of money into the community in the form of a community currency, based on local assets, increases local sales and helps directly develop the local economy. Sarafu-Credit, Grassroots Economics' Kenyan community currency program, creates stable markets based on local development and trust.”

## Non-Blockchain Money Management for Nonprofits

There are many organizing or activist groups that do not necessarily want to set up their own nonprofits, and so they seek fiscal hosting from larger, already established nonprofit entities. These groups can benefit from decentralized technologies to support their efforts in crowdsourced fundraising and transparent financial management.

### Example: [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com)

Open Collective is an online funding platform for open and transparent communities providing the tools to raise and share finances in full transparency. The Open Collective Foundation is also a 501(c)(3) that supports collectives with fiscal hosting or lends out its nonprofit status to groups that might not have access to the legal or infrastructural tools necessary to carry out their missions.
