# DWeb Use Cases for Civil Society


## Data Securitization & Verification

Besides for financial transactions, decentralized technologies can be leveraged to securely store other types of data including identity information, health records, geolocation data, text and image-based art, historical records, and more. 

Blockchains and other distributed data storage systems store copies of the data across a network of computers, all of which come together to validate that the data is accurate and has only been recorded once. This securitization and verification process, known as a “consensus mechanism,” makes the technology suitable for nonprofit objectives such as supply chain tracking, impact reporting, distributing media, archiving historical data, and supporting vulnerable populations with digital identity systems.

Decentralized technologies can provide many advantages to nonprofits that collect and utilize data for their work–including cost-efficiency. Other advantages of DWeb technologies are that they can make data processes more transparent, verifiable, easily traceable, and accessible to those relying on it.

## Use Cases Jobs To Be Done

### 1. Supply Chain Tracking

One of the most promising applications of emerging blockchain technology is supply chain management. Blockchain can help supply chain partners with some of their challenges by creating a complete, transparent, tamperproof history of the information flows, inventory flows, and financial flows in transactions.


According to [an article](https://bcgdv.com/our-work/opensc/) from BCG Digital Ventures, “Present-day systems (e.g., carbon accounting and certification schemes) typically rely entirely on manual audits—spot checks that happen from time to time. Technology can change that and take us further. For many of the most important sustainability and ethical production claims, it is possible to continuously sense relevant data and build systems that verify those claims automatically, continuously, for the whole of production, and often close to real time.”


#### Example: OpenSC


OpenSC is a joint venture by World Wildlife Fund Australia and BCG Digital Ventures. The OpenSC platform uses blockchain technology and real-time data to trace a product through its supply chain in order to make transparent and verifiable that it was produced in an ethically or sustainable way. The company started out tracking fish and beef and has since expanded traceability to items like palm oil and dairy. OpenSC typically focuses on improving transparency of commodities with known "environmental or human rights risks within their supply chains. Consumers can scan a QR code (typically on restaurant menus or on the product itself) to get access to the data about the product's history, which is stored on an open blockchain.

### 2. Impact Reporting

 Similar to the process for supply chain management, blockchain technology can be well-suited to support impact reporting for nonprofits because of the permanent record of transactions distributed across participants in a network making it more transparent and tamper-proof. For example, in the wide array of programs around the world which deal with emissions reduction credits (ERCs) or carbon credits, blockchain is being utilized to support the processes of measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV). Blockchain technology supports MRV by helping ensure buyers that the carbon credits they purchase are real, removing intermediaries from the process which can reduce the opportunity for corruption, and helping organizations such as the World Bank certify its emissions reductions programs are working. 


[According to the World Bank,](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/27/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-measurement-reporting-and-verification-mrv-of-carbon-credits) “While current methods to measure, report, and verify emission reductions can be costly and time-consuming, often relying on manual operations, digital technologies can streamline data collection, processing, and quality control in MRV processes, helping to reduce the cost and time to ERC issuance.”


 #### Example: [Evercity](https://evercity.io/)


Evercity combines blockchain with monitoring tools to increase data transparency avoiding greenwashing and enabling the issuance of fully traceable green digital assets: green and sustainability-linked debt instruments, carbon credits and forwards. Evercity also develops an open source sustainable finance protocol, which serves as a global common good infrastructure.

### 3. Digital Identification Management

A country’s identification system is the backbone for effective delivery of public and private services, yet [The World Bank estimates](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/08/14/inclusive-and-trusted-digital-id-can-unlock-opportunities-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable) that 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to basic ID credentials. Opening a bank account, sending and receiving money, enrolling in school, applying for a job, voting in an election, or traveling across country borders all require some form of identification. Therefore, the lack of access to identification creates barriers for oftentimes already marginalized individuals.


Many governments are exploring the development of multipurpose digital identification systems. However, many people are concerned about large, personal datasets being stored on centralized servers owned and run by any one private or public entity for the risk of compromise or even attack. Therefore, some projects are utilizing blockchain technology where the data is stored using a decentralized blockchain ledger. Also known as “self-sovereign identity​ systems,” these systems aim to put the data in control of the user, therefore providing data protections. These systems are mostly still in early development stages.


#### Example: [MOSIP](https://www.mosip.io/)

MOSIP is a robust, scalable and inclusive foundational identity platform. The Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP) helps Governments and other user organizations implement a digital, foundational identity system in a cost effective way. Nations can use MOSIP freely to build their own identity systems. Being modular in its architecture, MOSIP provides flexibility to countries in how they implement and configure their systems, and helps avoid vendor lock-in.

Anchored at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIIT-B), MOSIP harnesses the power of open source and embraces the best practices of scalability, security and privacy.

### 4. Verifying Media Truth / Legitimacy

Human rights defenders, civic journalists and critical truth-tellers in communities facing human rights violations are some of the populations often targeted for their work and told their media are lies.** **DWeb technologies can help fight misinformation by adding a layer of verifiable trust to all types of digital content, including documents, photos, and videos through provenance and attribution solutions. Similar to supply chain tracking, “data provenance” is a documented trail that accounts for the origin of a piece of data and where it has moved from to where it is presently. 


Depending on the project, it may be desirable to use a decentralized, immutable data technology, such as a distributed ledger or blockchain, to underwrite the integrity of the “manifest repository” or the digital location where information about the data asset is stored. It is important to note that, for safety or privacy reasons, someone might want to remove certain data from the repository, which would not be possible if the data is stored on a distributed ledger or blockchain. However, blockchains are useful for recording the event of the redaction, which can help build trust among users of the data.


 #### Example: [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org/)
 
The Content Authenticity Initiative is a community of researchers and developers building an ecosystem of open source tools and software development kits (SDKs) for working with digital content provenance creation and validation. Their technology uses a cryptographic asset hashing to provide verifiable, tamper-evident signatures that an image and its metadata hasn’t been unknowingly altered. At creation, the creator can choose what information to attach to the content being created. Throughout this process, the creator of content can choose to preserve attribution or to remain anonymous. Preservation of privacy for creators is central to this project.

#### 5. Digital Archiving

Decentralized data storage solutions enable data to be distributed across a global network of nodes rather than a centralized collection of servers owned by traditional corporate cloud storage providers which can be vulnerable to security breaches, outages, and monopolistic practices. The potential benefits of decentralized data storage solutions include enhanced security, user control, and affordability. The network’s consensus mechanisms ensure the secure storage and retrieval of data, maintaining the integrity of the stored files at all times. 


There are a few different options when it comes to decentralized alternatives to traditional cloud storage providers including Filecoin. Filecoin is an open-source cloud storage network that works complementary with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a novel decentralized web protocol designed as an alternative to the traditional HTTP protocol. Importantly, Filecoin’s Virtual Machine (FVM) enables Web3 developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and data decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on top of their storage infrastructure.


#### Example: [Starling Lab](https://www.starlinglab.org/) - The Testimony of Genocide


    The teams at Starling Lab and the USC Shoah Foundation deployed the Starling Framework to cryptographically capture the testimonies of 55,000 genocidal survivors from the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide, and the Rohingya crisis. First, the teams uploaded all of the USC Shoah Foundation’s current data (tex, images, videos) to IPFS and Filecoin so that it could be stored securely and protected through decentralization on-chain. From there, multiple organizations are invited to contribute to storing this data and experts brought in to verify the footage, contributing to the increased security and validity of the archive. Finally, this protocol created a chain of custody standard that could be utilized right from the start to capture, store, and verify new interviews from survivors.
