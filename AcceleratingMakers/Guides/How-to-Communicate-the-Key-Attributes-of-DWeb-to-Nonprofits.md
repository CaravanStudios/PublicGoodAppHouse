# How to Communicate the Key Attributes of DWeb to Nonprofits

_5 minute read_

The purpose of this document is to help DWeb Makers, developers, and organizers to **communicate the key features or attributes of decentralized technologies to nonprofits**. It is especially beneficial in addressing nondevelopers and those who might be (rightfully!) skeptical about the industry given its complexity, the speculation around it, media coverage, and much more.

First and foremost, it’s absolutely valid and healthy to critically evaluate decentralized technologies. We encourage everyone — especially nonprofits that sometimes serve very vulnerable communities — to do their research, ask tough questions, and adequately interrogate the risks and benefits of DWeb tools. In fact, we built a conversation guide called [Is DWeb for Me?](https://github.com/CaravanStudios/PublicGoodAppHouse/blob/1d8a280093ea1cfde2957000a21663d397d8f2a0/AcceleratingMakers/Guides/Is-DWeb-for-Me.md), which aims to help nonprofit leaders ask the right questions when evaluating decentralized technologies.

At the same time, our research has revealed many [use cases of decentralized technologies](https://github.com/CaravanStudios/PublicGoodAppHouse/tree/88f87f7a50c9bcf8998776eab8595c0964d609ba/AcceleratingMakers/UseCases#readme) for nonprofits and a variety of potential benefits to using DWeb over traditional centralized technologies. For nonprofits concerned with censorship, targeted ads, high fees, data control, or harmful surveillance practices, DWeb tools can be worth considering.

We designed this resource to help DWeb Makers communicate the features of DWeb to nonprofit audiences. Our goal is to help proponents of DWeb responsibly introduce these core concepts and foster open and honest dialogues with civil society leaders about the potential benefits of these emerging technologies while also acknowledging the limitations.


## What Is DWeb, and Why Should Nonprofits Care?

DWeb (decentralized web) is a collection of technologies and protocols designed to create a web that is more open, secure, resistant to censorship, and privacy-respecting than the current centralized web. Unlike centralized platforms like Google and Facebook, which store data on their own servers and have the power to censor content or sell user data to advertisers, DWeb technologies distribute data across a network of nodes and give users greater control over their information. **In decentralized environments, no single entity has the power to modify, delete, or manipulate the data stored on these servers**.

## Key Attributes of DWeb for Nonprofits

Below are the core attributes or features of decentralized technologies that might provide benefits to nonprofit organizations.


### Privacy

In the decentralized web, privacy involves safeguarding user data from corporate or government surveillance. Decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are often run by nonprofits or groups of volunteers and provide more options for controlling data access within networks. Also, many decentralized services offer strong encryption, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read the messages.


### Security

Security in the decentralized web is characterized by the absence of a single point of failure. Unlike centralized systems, which have vulnerable points of attack (“supernodes”), decentralized networks distribute control across various nodes. This distribution mitigates the risk of service interruptions (like Internet shutdowns, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, or other types of malicious cyberattacks, natural disasters, etc.) if certain nodes are compromised.


### Immutability

Immutability, in the context of DWeb, refers to the quality of data that prevents it from being changed or modified once it has been recorded. Once data is added to a distributed network, it is duplicated across many nodes and verified using consensus protocols. This ensures that once something is published to the DWeb, it can't be arbitrarily altered or removed by any single party. For archival records or data that is relatively unchanging, DWeb can provide resilient and long-term backup.


### Censorship Resistance

Centralized platforms might engage in algorithmic or manual censorship of content or denial of service, which can censor nonprofit advocacy and outreach and impair operations. Example targets could include banks, payment processors, or web hosting providers. Censorship resistance is a key feature of DWeb technologies. When data is distributed across multiple nodes, it reduces reliance on centralized servers under the control of a single government or organization that can censor and take down content. Distributed ledger technology can also be used to record transactions and ensure legitimacy, making it more challenging to alter or censor data.


### Transparency and Trust

Transparency in the DWeb implies that all transactions and data are visible to participants (unless encrypted), which ensures trust and accountability to stakeholders. Transparency can also refer to the open-source code on which the systems usually run, which allows anyone to see how the system works and even contribute to the underlying source code.


### Decentralized Governance and Collective Input

Decentralized networks encourage collaborative and participatory governance as opposed to more traditional hierarchical models commonly found in centralized systems. On the technical level, there are “consensus mechanisms” that ensure that all nodes in the network agree that all transactions are valid. On the human level, decentralized organizations can more easily program participatory and democratic decision-making processes into the technology (for example by using [smart contracts](https://github.com/CaravanStudios/PublicGoodAppHouse/tree/88f87f7a50c9bcf8998776eab8595c0964d609ba/AcceleratingMakers/DwebExplainers#readme)).


### Cost Efficiency

DWeb offers the potential for reduced costs associated with data storage and bandwidth. In a decentralized system, reliance on expensive and corporatized central servers is diminished since data can be hosted across distributed, volunteer-run nodes. DWeb can also sometimes enable the elimination of intermediaries, reducing the need for complex backend systems and decreasing the time and resources spent on maintaining these systems.


### Function in Offline Environments

Some decentralized, peer-to-peer technology does not require reliable Internet connections to work, making it a good option for remote communities or those without strong or consistent Internet access.


### Scalability and Reliability

DWeb technologies are designed to scale more easily than traditional centralized web services. As more nodes join the network, the system becomes more capable of handling large amounts of data and traffic.


### Innovation, Competitive Advantage, and Preparing for the Future

Decentralization is an emerging trend. We want nonprofits to be leaders, rather than be left behind. Adopting DWeb can position a nonprofit organization as a leader in technological innovation, exploring new business models and services that were not possible under the centralized web paradigm.


### Reduced Reliance on For-Profit Platforms

By using decentralized tools, nonprofits can avoid the risks of having their data or content controlled by companies that may not share their values.


## Considerations and Concerns


### Legal Compliance and Reputation Concerns

Nonprofits that adopt decentralized technologies must continue to comply with data protection laws, financial regulations, and reporting requirements, while managing legal accountability across multiple jurisdictions. They also face reputation risks and potential trust issues with stakeholders because these technologies are sometimes associated with illicit activities. To mitigate these concerns, nonprofits should conduct thorough risk assessments, engage experts, and maintain clear communication with stakeholders.


### User Experience

Decentralized technologies face user experience challenges including complexity, less intuitive interfaces, potentially slower performance, and heightened security responsibilities for users. Additionally, interoperability difficulties and lack of centralized support can further hinder ease of use and adoption.


### Sustainability and Environmental Impact

Some decentralized networks rely on significant computational power, leading to high energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. Though this is the case for much of the technology we use, it is important that nonprofits be aware of this when evaluating whether to adopt decentralized technologies. DWeb tools using proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms are [more energy-intensive](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/whats-environmental-impact-cryptocurrency/) than those using proof-of-stake (PoS).


### Oher Potential Benefits or Limitations of DWeb

While many DWeb tools are still in early stages of development, it is always useful to explore the possibilities, ask questions, and keep learning about this emerging technology industry.
